# World Lore & Reference
...


This page serves as a central reference for the world, species, and phenomena surrounding **The Hunters & Amelia**.

It is not a complete history, but rather a collection of explanations meant to answer common questions and provide grounding context for the stories.

---

## Terra

**Terra** is an alternate Earth-like planet characterized by a single massive supercontinent and a near-utopian balance between civilization and nature.

Most of Terra’s population lives within **twelve enormous cities** distributed across the landmass. These cities are culturally and technologically advanced, and largely peaceful.

Outside the cities lie vast wild regions, farmland, forests, and mountains — areas primarily inhabited and maintained by non-human species.

Humans are the most common species on Terra and provide much of the social and infrastructural framework that allows other species to coexist within city life.

## The Three Moons of Terra

Terra has **three moons**, all visually similar to Earth’s Moon but differing in apparent size:

- **Luna Minor** — the smallest  
- **Luna** — the standard-sized moon  
- **Luna Major** — the largest  

All three moons rise and set **simultaneously** each day.

### Luna Minor

Staring at **Luna Minor** is widely believed to cause:
- Existential dread
- A vibrating or throbbing sensation in the center of the skull
- Disorientation or loss of consciousness

For some individuals, Luna Minor acts as a **dream trigger**, increasing lucidity or forcing a transition between dream states. This phenomenon is poorly understood and often dismissed as superstition.

## Sauromorphs

**Sauromorphs** are an ancient species native to Terra, consisting of dinosaur–human hybrids. They are among the rarest and oldest living species.

### Cultural History

During the era analogous to Earth’s Biblical Flood, Sauromorphs survived by constructing large rafts. Many perished, but those who adapted — particularly raptor-like subspecies — became the most common survivors.

Sauromorph culture often emphasizes:
- Family cooperation
- Multi-generational households
- Practical skills
- Farming and land stewardship

It is common practice for Sauromorph families to hatch only **one egg per clutch**, allowing older siblings to help raise younger ones — especially important on farms.

---

## Austroraptorian Sauromorphs

The Hunter family belongs to the **Austroraptorian** subspecies.

### Physical Traits

- Feathered bodies with **waterproof feathers**
- Shark-like teeth
- High metabolism despite large size
- Average height: 6 ft or taller
- Waterproof feather oils require regular maintenance

Austroraptorians float naturally when swimming, similar to ducks, but are less buoyant if feathers become fully soaked.

---

## Sauromorph Biology & Metabolism

Metabolism varies by subspecies.

For Austroraptorians:
- Bathroom needs occur approximately every **3–4 days**
- Urges can be sudden rather than gradual
- Physical preparedness is culturally normalized

For Lamias:
- Digestive cycles are much slower
- Bathroom needs occur roughly **once per month**

These differences are biological, not medical concerns.

---

## Lamias

Lamias are snake-bodied humanoids with anatomy similar to real snakes below the waist.

### Amelia’s Lamia Biology

- No legs
- One large functional lung and one vestigial lung
- Organs concentrated near center of mass
- Monthly shedding cycle affecting mood and energy
- Does not grow during shedding — it is cyclical maintenance

Humans often misunderstand Lamia anatomy despite explanations and diagrams.

---

## Dreams & Lucidity

Some individuals experience **persistent lucid dreaming** with consistent dream locations, recurring characters, and internal continuity.

- Ashley and Lewis are both lucid dreamers
- Lewis documents dreams extensively
- Ashley retains intuitive memory of dream spaces
- Eric experiences symbolic or spiritually meaningful dreams
- Jeannie finds dream discussions difficult to follow

Dreams are culturally interpreted in different ways within the family.

## The Rift of Silver Hollow

**Silver Hollow** was a small farm town near ancient forested mountains resembling Earth’s Appalachian region.

One night, a glowing blue fog surrounded the town. Those who entered it vanished.

The town was later understood to be encased within a **Tyredon-based extradimensional rift**, originating from **Universe K-23**.

### Effects of the Rift

- The town exists outside normal space and time
- Buildings decay but remain frozen in a post-abandonment state
- No seasonal progression occurs
- Only the church on the hill remains pristine
- Nature has reclaimed most structures

The rift appears to have limited intelligence and does not separate closely bonded individuals unless chosen.

### Ashley Hunter — Singing

*Ashley rarely sings for others. These recordings preserve moments that would otherwise be lost. This one is a song about Silver Hollow.*

## Displacement to Earth

Ashley crossed the rift first.

Months later, the rest of the Hunter family followed, choosing uncertainty over separation.

Amelia crossed the rift independently from another location on Terra.

All now reside on Earth, adapting to a human-dominated world.

---

## Earth vs Terra

Key differences Terrans must adjust to:

- Fireworks (unknown on Terra)
- Calendar-based holidays
- Human-only infrastructure
- Lack of non-human accommodations
- Vehicles not designed for non-human bodies

Despite this, Earth offers new freedoms, relationships, and growth.

---

## Shifters

Shifters are rare beings believed on Terra to be mythical and untrustworthy.

In reality, they are capable of:
- Shapeshifting
- Extreme emotional sensitivity
- Strong attachment bonds

**Primal** is a known Shifter who uses a humanoid form to blend in and lives with Ashley and Amelia.

---

## Tone of the World

The Hunters & Amelia universe is defined by:
- Slice-of-life moments
- Emotional realism
- Gentle humor
- Family dynamics
- Adaptation rather than conquest

This world is not about grand wars or heroes — it is about **people learning how to live** after everything familiar has changed.
