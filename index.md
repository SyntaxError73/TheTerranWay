# The Terran Way
...


Welcome to a personal fiction archive featuring original characters and slice-of-life stories set across Terra, Earth, and beyond.

This collection exists as a small library of scenes, lore, and character moments created for storytelling, reflection, and enjoyment.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal fiction archive featuring original characters and stories set in the K-23 Universe.

While some character traits, family dynamics, and experiences are *inspired* by my own life and family, the Hunter family is **not meant to represent real people one-to-one**.

Some scenes and excerpts were created with the help of **ChatGPT**, then curated, edited, and expanded by me.

This collection is recommended for a **mature audience**, as some scenes include intense emotions, difficult topics, or heavy themes.

All content is shared for **entertainment and storytelling purposes only**.
