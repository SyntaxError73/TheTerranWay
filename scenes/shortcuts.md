### **Shortcuts**

Ashley loved shortcuts.

They were faster. Usually.
And even when they weren’t, they were *interesting*.

The forest path split just past the creek — one trail worn smooth by hikers, looping gently around the ridge. The other barely qualified as a trail at all, disappearing into a mess of undergrowth and shadow.

Ashley glanced at both, grinned, and took the second one.

“Won’t take long,” she muttered to herself, ducking under a low branch.

Five minutes later, she was waist-deep in brambles.

Thorns snagged at her feathers and sleeves, thin branches springing back with sharp little protests. She hissed once when a thorn caught bare skin, then laughed, shaking it off.

“Okay,” she said cheerfully, pushing forward. “Rude, but fair.”

She powered through with the confidence of someone who had absolutely made worse decisions before. Scratches accumulated — shallow, stinging, already beading red in places. A thorn snagged her arm; she freed it with a practiced twist. Another caught her leg; she stepped through it without breaking stride.

By the time she burst free on the other side, feathers ruffled and hair sticking up at odd angles, she was grinning.

“See?” she said aloud, to no one. “Shortcut.”

She made it home with dirt on her clothes, twigs in her feathers, and a few new scrapes for the collection.

Primal was in the kitchen when she came in.

He looked up once — took her in from head to tail — and smiled.

“Brambles?” he guessed.

“Thick ones,” Ashley confirmed proudly, dropping her pack on the floor. She rummaged through it immediately, pulling out her first aid kit like a magician producing a scarf.

She sat down at the table and began peeling open adhesive bandages — bright ones, patterned with cartoon animals and stars. She slapped one over a scrape on her arm. It stuck for about three seconds before sliding slightly sideways on her feathers.

“…You’re doing your best,” she told it.

Primal leaned against the counter, arms crossed loosely, watching with fond amusement. “That’s a new one,” he said, nodding at a thin cut along her forearm.

“Oh, that?” She glanced at it. “Yeah, that one tried real hard.”

She added another bandage — dinosaurs this time — overlapping the first in an optimistic attempt at coverage. It didn’t help much, but she seemed satisfied.

Primal chuckled softly. “You had a good time.”

Ashley beamed. “The best.”

She finished patching herself up — arms now dotted with mismatched bandages, some already peeling at the edges — and finally looked up at him.

“What?”

He shook his head. “Nothing. Just… you look happy.”

“I am,” she said easily. “Little scratched. Little muddy. Worth it.”

She stood, stretching, completely unbothered by the scrapes, the sting already fading into background noise.

Primal watched her move past, tail flicking once in quiet affection.

To him, the bandages weren’t signs of injury.

They were proof.

That Ashley lived fully.
That she chose the harder path when it looked fun.
That she came home every time — scraped, smiling, and absolutely herself.

And that was something worth admiring.
