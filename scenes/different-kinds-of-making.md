### **Different Kinds of Making**

Ashley watched Amelia draw.

She always did.

The pencil moved easily in Amelia’s hand, lines appearing soft and confident, like they’d been waiting there the whole time. Lewis sat nearby, tablet balanced on his knee, muttering to himself as he adjusted something on the screen.

Ashley leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, tail swaying lazily.

After a while, she said, “I ain’t good at that.”

Neither of them looked up.

Amelia smiled anyway. “You don’t have to be.”

Ashley shrugged. “I know. I just… see what y’all do. My brain don’t work like that.”

Lewis glanced over. “You draw fine.”

Ashley snorted. “Nah. I draw *slow*. And clumsy. And it never looks how I mean it to.”

She paused, searching for the right words. “Feels like I’m talkin’ with my mouth full.”

Amelia finally set her pencil down. “You make things too. Just… different things.”

Ashley nodded. “Yeah.”

She gestured vaguely outside. “I’d rather be out there, stackin’ boards with Eric. Figurin’ out which branch ain’t gonna snap. Seein’ if it’ll hold weight.”

Lewis grinned. “You like stuff that argues back.”

“Exactly,” Ashley said, pointing at him. “Wood talks. You just gotta listen.”

Amelia chuckled softly.

Ashley continued, more thoughtful now. “Drawin’ feels like I’m chasin’ somethin’ already done. But buildin’? You mess up, you fix it. You lean on it. You *test* it.”

She smiled, small but sure. “Feels honest.”

Eric’s voice drifted in from outside. “Y’all ready or what?”

Ashley straightened immediately. “Comin’!”

She hesitated, then added quietly, “Y’all make beautiful things. I’m just… better at holdin’ ‘em up.”

Amelia looked at the half-finished sketch on her desk. Lewis glanced at his screen.

Both of them knew that was true.

Ashley headed for the door, already thinking about knots and nails and which tree would make the best support beam.

Different kinds of making.

All of them necessary.
