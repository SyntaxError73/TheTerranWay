### **Right Before Sleep**

Amelia mentioned it offhandedly.

They were all winding down for the night, the house dim and quiet, when she paused in the doorway like a thought had caught on something invisible.

“…Do you ever hear things,” she asked carefully, “right before you fall asleep?”

Lewis looked up immediately. “Define ‘things.’”

“Sentences,” Amelia said. “Words. They don’t mean anything. They just… appear.”

Lewis snapped his fingers. “Hypnagogia.”

Ashley, halfway through scrolling on her phone, froze. “Hold on.”

Lewis grinned. “It’s a real thing.”

Ashley narrowed her eyes. “You say that about *everything*.”

She typed quickly, thumb flying. A few seconds passed.

“…Oh,” she said. “Dang. He’s right.”

Amelia blinked. “It has a name?”

“Yep,” Lewis said. “Your brain misfiring as it shuts systems down. Random linguistic fragments. Totally normal.”

Ashley nodded. “Yeah, I get that all the time.”

Amelia turned toward her slowly. “You do?”

“Mmhmm.” Ashley unlocked her phone again. “I keep a file.”

Lewis snorted. “You gotta show her.”

Ashley hesitated just a second. Then shrugged. “Alright.”

She handed the phone over.

---

The document was… extensive.

Line after line of sentences, each separated cleanly, no context, no explanation.

> *The moon forgot its shoes.*
> *Don’t microwave the map.*
> *That’s not a horse, that’s a suggestion.*
> *Someone left the gravity on.*
> *Tell the tree I said sorry.*
> *Why is the soup political.*

Amelia stared.

Then she laughed — soft at first, then harder, hand covering her mouth.

“This is—” she tried again. “This is absurd.”

Lewis beamed. “Told you. Pure gold.”

Ashley leaned over her shoulder. “That one about the soup happened right before I passed out.”

Amelia scrolled further, eyes wide. “You remember all of these?”

Ashley shrugged. “Only ‘cause I write ‘em down. If I don’t, they vanish.”

Amelia frowned thoughtfully. “I never remember what I hear.”

Lewis glanced at her. “That’s ‘cause you don’t externalize it.”

Ashley nodded. “Yeah. Brains are slippery like that.”

Amelia handed the phone back, still smiling. “I always thought it was unimportant.”

Ashley tilted her head. “Doesn’t have to be important to be interesting.”

Amelia considered that.

Later that night, as she settled into bed, she heard it again — a voice, not hers, not anyone’s.

*The lamps are gossiping.*

She smiled faintly.

And for the first time, she reached for her phone and opened a blank note.

Just in case.
