### **New Year’s Eve**

On Terra, time was not something you celebrated.
It moved. It cycled. It returned.
Calendars existed, but no one ever stood still long enough to applaud them.

So when Ashley learned that Earth gathered together on one specific night just to acknowledge that a number had changed, she didn’t quite understand it.

At first.

The house was warm. Too warm, honestly — Earth buildings liked to trap heat instead of sharing it. Someone had put music on. Someone else had food that came in shiny wrappers. The important person explained, casually, that people would count down soon.

“Down to what?” Ashley asked.

They laughed. Not unkindly.
“To the new year.”

Ashley nodded like that explained anything.

Then the noise started.

A sharp crack split the air. Then another. Then a rapid series of concussive booms that rattled the windows. Ashley was on her feet instantly, head tilting, posture alert but not frightened.

“Is there a range nearby?” she asked, already moving toward the door. “Someone’s firing fast.”

Before anyone could stop her, she opened it.

Cold slammed into her like a living thing.

The night air burned her lungs, bit at the exposed skin of her neck and face. Snow crunched underfoot. Her breath fogged instantly — thick, visible, *real*. She stepped out anyway.

And then the sky bloomed.

Light exploded upward and outward, bursting into colors that didn’t belong to anything natural — neon reds, electric blues, gold so bright it hurt to look at. Shapes appeared and vanished in seconds, replaced by others just as quickly. The sound followed each burst, rolling and echoing like thunder that had learned to laugh.

Ashley stood there, frozen in more ways than one.

They weren’t weapons.

They were… offerings.

She laughed once, softly, the sound fogging the air in front of her mouth. Another firework burst overhead, and she craned her neck back, feathers along her arms puffing slightly as if her body didn’t know whether to brace or reach.

“You waste this much sound,” she murmured, mostly to herself,
“on *joy*?”

Someone called for her to come back inside. That it was freezing. That she’d catch a cold. She waved them off without looking away from the sky.

On Terra, celebrations were quiet. Songs hummed low. Lights were steady. Joy was something you carried, not something you hurled into the heavens.

Here, joy *detonated*.

She stayed out there until her fingers ached and her tail-tip was dusted with frost, until the booms slowed and the sky finally went dark again. Only then did she exhale, long and slow, like she’d been holding her breath for an entire year she didn’t even know she was counting.

Later — much later — she would write a song about it.

About lights that didn’t last.
About noise that meant nothing but happiness.
About a world that marked survival by shouting into the cold night sky and daring it to answer back.

But that night, she just stood there, shivering and smiling, watching Earth teach her that sometimes…
it’s okay to celebrate simply because you’re still here.
