### **Snow Birds**

Ashley stands on the porch, barefoot.

The snow is already soaking into the feathers around her ankles, cold enough that her toes ache in that sharp, honest way. Her feathers puff up automatically, like her body’s arguing with the weather on her behalf.

She scowls at the yard.

“I still hate this,” she mutters.

Snow days ruin everything she actually wants to do.

The woods are silent—too silent. No squirrels. No movement. Just white and stillness. Hunting’s pointless. Fire-starting feels like a cruel joke. Even sticks snap wrong when she tries to test one, frozen stiff and uncooperative.

She sighs.

“…but I gotta.”

Ashley steps down into the snow and crouches, hands already numb as she scoops a careful pile together. She packs it slowly, deliberately, fingers shaping curves she’s memorized since childhood.

Not a snowman.

A bird.

She pinches a beak. Pulls a little ridge up for the tail, upright and alert. Smooths the back until it looks like it could *breathe* if it wanted to.

Her nose is red by the time she’s done.

She carries it carefully across the yard and sets it on top of the birdhouse, where it looks… right. Like it belongs there. Like it might flutter off if you blink.

Ashley takes out her phone, snaps a picture.

“Okay,” she whispers to herself. “Did it.”

Another year.

---

A snowball hits the railing behind her.

*WHUMP.*

Ashley yelps and spins.

Lewis is already cackling, halfway across the yard, trying to roll a snowball that is *far* too big to be practical. It’s uneven, lumpy, and getting wider by the second.

“This one’s gonna have *mass*,” he shouts.

Eric, several yards away, doesn’t even look at Lewis’s monstrosity. He’s kneeling, packing snow into tight, smooth spheres. Testing the weight. Adjusting the surface.

Ashley narrows her eyes.

She scoops up snow quietly, trying to be subtle. She crouches behind the porch post, packs it fast, then pops out—

—and throws.

The snowball sails beautifully.

Past Eric.

Past Lewis.

It lands nowhere near either of them.

There’s a pause.

Eric looks over slowly.

Lewis stops rolling his snow boulder and grins. “Oh.”

Eric straightens. “It’s on.”

Ashley squeaks.

“Nope— nope— I’m sorry—!”

Too late.

Eric’s first snowball flies clean and fast, whizzing past Ashley’s shoulder close enough that she yelps and ducks instinctively.

Lewis heaves his giant snowball with a roar. It immediately disintegrates mid-air.

They both stare at it.

“…Worth it,” Lewis decides.

Ashley shrieks and runs, feet slipping, feathers fluffed to maximum indignation. She tries to dodge behind the tree stump, laughing and yelling and absolutely failing to stay hidden.

“STOP— STOP— I’M BAREFOOT—!”

“That’s a *you* problem!” Lewis calls, already packing another impossible sphere.

Eric’s snowballs are mercilessly accurate.

Ashley throws back wildly, missing almost every time, screaming anyway like it counts. Snow gets in her hair. Down her back. Somewhere it definitely shouldn’t be.

She’s breathless, cold, and grinning despite herself.

Eventually, she retreats to the porch again, hands shaking, cheeks burning.

Eric lowers his aim. Lewis flops into the snow dramatically.

Ashley looks out over the yard, then up at the birdhouse.

The snow bird is still there.

Perfectly intact.

She snorts softly. “Huh.”

She wraps her arms around herself, shivering.

“I still hate snow days,” she announces to no one in particular.

Eric smiles.
Lewis laughs.

Ashley glances at the bird again, then down at her freezing feet.

“…but I guess,” she admits, “I can work with ‘em.”

And yeah.

That tracks.

### **Afterward**

The house smells like woodsmoke.

Not the outdoor kind—this is deeper, steadier. The fireplace crackles low and confident, flames tucked behind glass, doing their job without showing off.

Ashley is sprawled on the rug in front of it, feathers still faintly damp, tail curled around herself like it’s learned a new survival tactic.

Her feet are *bright red*.

She sticks them closer to the glass, then pulls them back with a hiss.
“Too hot— nope— too hot— okay— again.”

Eric sits on the hearth with a mug in his hands, steam curling up past his face. He watches her with quiet amusement.

“Circulation’ll come back,” he says calmly.

“I know,” Ashley mutters, voice muffled because she’s pressed her cheek into the rug. “I just wish it’d hurry.”

Lewis collapses onto the couch, snow still clinging to his hair. “Worth it.”

Ashley lifts her head. “You disintegrated your *entire* snowball.”

“It was a proof of concept,” Lewis says. “A failure-based prototype.”

John stirs the fire once, precise and practiced. “Y’all hungry?”

Ashley perks up instantly. “Yes.”

Jeannie drapes a blanket over Ashley without comment, tucking it around her shoulders and—very deliberately—around her feet.

Ashley melts.

“Ohhh,” she sighs. “There it is.”

The fire pops softly. The room settles.

Outside, the snow bird remains on its perch, watching through the window like it always has.

Inside, warmth creeps back into fingers and toes. Laughter fades into quiet conversation. No one rushes anything.

Ashley stretches one leg experimentally, toes flexing.

“…Okay,” she says, satisfied. “I’m alive again.”

Lewis grins. “Welcome back.”

She smiles, eyes half-lidded, safe and warm and still a little smug.

Snow days are terrible.

But fireplaces?

Fireplaces track.
