### **Standing Her Ground**

Ashley had stopped moving.

Not dramatically. Not loudly.

Just… stopped.

Eric noticed first. He always did.

They were halfway down the dirt path that cut between the trees, the one that led toward the creek. Ashley had been walking ahead, relaxed, tail swaying, humming under her breath — and then she wasn’t.

Eric took two more steps before realizing she wasn’t beside him anymore.

He turned.

Ashley stood planted in the path, feet set wide, weight settled deep into the ground like roots had grown overnight. Her tail lay heavy behind her. Her feathers weren’t flared — they didn’t need to be. This wasn’t fear.

This was decision.

“Ash?” Eric asked. “You comin’?”

She didn’t answer right away. She was looking at the fork ahead — one path narrower, overgrown, quicker. The other longer, safer, slower.

Finally, she said, “Nope.”

Lewis blinked. “Nope… what?”

“I ain’t takin’ that trail,” she said, calm as could be.

“It’s faster,” Lewis argued. “And it’s fine, we’ve been through there before.”

Ashley’s jaw tightened. Just a little.

“I said nope.”

Eric sighed quietly. Not annoyed — resigned. “What’s wrong with it?”

Ashley shifted her weight, claws digging in slightly. “Don’t like it.”

Lewis threw his hands up. “That’s not a reason!”

Ashley turned her head slowly to look at him.

“It is for me.”

They stood there for a moment.

The woods were quiet. Cicadas buzzed. Somewhere far off, a bird called.

Ashley wasn’t angry. She wasn’t defensive. She just *was*.

She knew how this went. Push her, and she’d dig in deeper. Not because she couldn’t bend — but because she wouldn’t be bent for the wrong reasons.

Eric studied her for a long second, then nodded. “Alright.”

Lewis stared at him. “You’re just… givin’ up?”

Eric shrugged. “She ain’t scared. She ain’t confused. She just made a call.”

Ashley glanced at Eric, something warm flickering across her face. Gratitude, maybe.

She added quietly, “I’ll change when I know it’s good for me. Not ‘cause someone tells me I should.”

Lewis groaned. “You’re like a brick wall.”

Ashley snorted. “Nah. I’m like a cow.”

Eric laughed. “That checks out.”

They took the longer path.

It cost them time. Dirt on their shoes. A few extra mosquito bites.

Ashley walked easy the whole way — relaxed, unbothered, confident in her choice.

Later, when Lewis tripped over a root on the narrow trail they *would’ve* taken, he muttered, “Okay… maybe you were right.”

Ashley didn’t gloat.

She just smiled, soft and stubborn, and kept walking.

Because Ashley didn’t need to prove she was right.

She just needed to know she hadn’t betrayed herself.
