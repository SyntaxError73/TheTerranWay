### **Lakeside**

By the time the pontoon was tied off and the sun began to dip low enough to turn the water gold, the smell of food had already taken over the shore.

John stood proudly over the grill, tongs in hand like a conductor’s baton. Smoke curled upward, carrying the unmistakable promise of barbecue and fried fish.

“Now I’m tellin’ y’all,” he said, flipping a fillet with practiced confidence, “this here’s the good stuff. None of that dry nonsense. You let the fish tell you when it’s done.”

Lewis nodded solemnly. “Wise words.”

Eric snorted. “You say that every time, Dad.”

“And I’m right every time.”

Amelia sat at the picnic table, tail coiled neatly beneath and around the bench, cooler open at her side. She produced a small bundle wrapped carefully in paper and set it down.

“I also brought something,” she said.

Ashley glanced over. “That sounds ominous.”

“They’re exotic game meat sticks,” Amelia replied, very matter-of-fact. “Dried. Spiced. Ethically sourced.”

Lewis leaned in immediately. “From where.”

“Several places,” Amelia said. “Some of which I’m not naming.”

Eric raised an eyebrow. “Are they… safe?”

“Yes,” Amelia replied, offended. “I wouldn’t poison your family.”

John laughed. “Well hell, pass ‘em over then.”

Meanwhile, Lewis and Eric had migrated toward the edge of the clearing, each armed with a fallen tree branch. Lewis swung his experimentally.

“You ready to lose, big brother?”

Eric grinned. “Boy, I’ve been ready since you picked up that stick.”

They clacked branches together, dramatic and entirely unserious, circling each other like knights who had learned everything they knew from movies and zero actual training.

“En garde!” Lewis declared.

Eric promptly knocked the stick out of his hands.

Lewis stared. “…Cheap shot.”

Ashley had wandered off toward the treeline, crouching near a rotting log with intense focus. She carefully rolled it over, eyes scanning beneath.

“C’mon,” she murmured. “I know y’all are in here.”

Primal watched her from a respectful distance, fascinated. “What are you looking for?”

“Snakes,” Ashley said cheerfully.

He stiffened slightly. “The… Amelia kind?”

She laughed. “No, no. Regular ones. Earth snakes. Much smaller. Usually grumpy.”

As if summoned, a small garter snake wriggled free and darted away. Ashley’s face lit up.

“There you go! Look at that little fella.”

Primal leaned closer, curious. “It’s… very different.”

“Yeah,” Ashley said softly. “Still beautiful, though.”

Back at the grill, John slapped at his neck for the fifth time in as many minutes. “Dagnabbit!”

Jeannie didn’t even look up from arranging plates. “Mosquito?”

“Mosquitoes,” John corrected. “Plural. They’re huntin’ me.”

Lewis called from across the clearing, “They know quality blood when they smell it!”

John glared. “You wanna trade?”

Eric suddenly froze mid-swing, eyes locked on the ground near his boot.

“…Nope.”

Lewis blinked. “What.”

Eric backed away slowly. “There’s somethin’ crawlin’.”

Jeannie sighed. “Eric—”

“It’s got too many legs,” he said firmly. “That ain’t natural.”

Ashley peeked over from the treeline. “House centipede?”

Eric made a sound of absolute betrayal. “WHY IS IT *HERE*.”

Amelia calmly leaned over, peered at it, then gently nudged it away with a stick. “It’s harmless. Also terrified of you.”

Eric shuddered. “I don’t care. It’s unclean.”

Lewis grinned. “Big scary raptor man, defeated by Bug Number One.”

Eric pointed at him. “You’re next.”

Eventually, plates were filled and passed around. Barbecue glistened. Fried fish crackled. Amelia’s meat sticks were sampled cautiously — then devoured enthusiastically.

“These are good,” John admitted. “Real good.”

Amelia smiled, just a little.

Primal sat beside her, taking it all in — the noise, the laughter, the easy way everyone flowed around each other. He accepted a plate when offered, nodding his thanks.

Ashley returned, dirt-smudged and happy, flopping down beside him. “Find anything fun?”

“Mostly confusion,” he replied.

She laughed, leaning into him briefly, comfortable and warm.

As the sky darkened and fireflies began to blink into existence, Amelia watched the Hunters laugh and bicker and eat. She sipped her drink, tail relaxed, and thought — not for the first time — that despite the chaos, the bugs, the smoke, and the near-miss with the centipede…

This felt like home.

Even if it was loud.

And smelled like barbecue.
