### **“Let’s See What Happens”**

Ashley never called it an experiment.

Experiments implied expectations.

This was different.

She knelt in the garden with her sleeves rolled up, carefully transferring pollen with a soft brush, humming under her breath. Two flowers that absolutely did not belong together — at least, not according to any book — waited patiently.

“What’re you hopin’ for?” Lewis asked, crouched nearby with a notebook already open.

Ashley shrugged. “Somethin’ neat.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It is for me.”

She dusted the pollen, gentle as if the plants could feel anticipation.

It wasn’t just flowers.

Ashley had started reading about reptile and amphibian genetics too — coloration, pattern inheritance, temperature-dependent traits. Not obsessively. Not academically. Just… curiously.

She liked how unpredictable it all was.

“Reptiles don’t follow the rules like mammals do,” she said once, scrolling through an article. “It’s like the world rolls dice every time.”

Lewis’s eyes lit up. “Oh, you’re gonna *love* polygenic expression.”

“I already do,” she said, without knowing the term yet.

Eric built whatever she needed.

Raised beds with adjustable shade. Enclosures that could be warmed or cooled slightly. Solid, practical structures that let Ashley’s curiosity roam safely.

“You sure this one’s tall enough?” he asked, tightening a bolt.

Ashley eyed it. “Might need more room if it gets… weird.”

Eric smiled faintly. “We can add on.”

He always said it like that. *If*. Not *when*. No pressure.

Weeks passed.

Something sprouted.

Ashley hovered over it like a kid on hatch day.

Lewis peered over her shoulder. “…That’s not either parent.”

Ashley’s grin spread slowly. “I know.”

It wasn’t what she’d imagined — the colors were unexpected, the shape slightly off — but it was *alive*, and it was *new*.

She didn’t cheer. Didn’t celebrate loudly.

She just sat back on her heels, eyes bright, quietly delighted.

“I wonder what else I can make happen,” she murmured.

Lewis scribbled notes. Eric brought over water. Amelia sketched the plant carefully, already preserving the moment.

Ashley rested her hands in the dirt, content.

Not chasing results.

Just asking the world a question and listening closely to the answer.

And whatever grew next?

That would be part of the fun.
