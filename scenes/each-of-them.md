### **What Each of Them Is For**

When Ashley had an idea, Lewis made it bigger.

Not louder — *wider*.

She’d toss something out half-formed, a thought she wasn’t even sure she believed in yet, and Lewis would grab it like it was already real.

“What if—” she’d say.

Lewis would lean forward. “Yes. And then—”

Suddenly it wasn’t just a thought anymore. It was a world. A theory. A system. Something worth exploring. He never asked if it was silly. Never asked if it made sense. He assumed it did and built scaffolding around it until it *had* to.

Ashley trusted him with her weird ideas because he treated them like raw material, not jokes.

Lewis didn’t ground her.

He launched her.

Eric did the opposite.

When Ashley got overwhelmed — when her chest felt tight, when she started talking too fast, when frustration crept into her voice — Eric didn’t add anything.

He *took things away*.

Noise. Pressure. Expectations.

He’d sit beside her without comment. Hand her something solid to hold. Say something simple and true.

“You’re alright.”
“Take your time.”
“You ain’t gotta fix this right now.”

He didn’t need to understand every detail to be there.

Ashley trusted Eric with her feelings because he didn’t try to steer them. He didn’t escalate or analyze or problem-solve unless she asked.

He just made sure she didn’t drift too far.

Eric didn’t inspire her.

He *anchored* her.

---

Lewis made Ashley feel like anything was possible.

Eric made her feel like she was safe even when it wasn’t.

And Ashley, standing between them, learned how to dream *and* how to stay.

Which is why she could be bold without being reckless, creative without being lost, and strong without being alone.

Some people push you forward.

Some people keep you grounded.

Ashley was lucky enough to have both.
