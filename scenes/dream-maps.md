### **Places That Only Exist at Night**

Ashley and Lewis talk about dreams the way some people talk about hometowns.

Not vaguely. Not metaphorically.

Specifically.

“The river bends left after the old bridge,” Lewis will say.
“And that’s where the market always is,” Ashley adds. “Unless it’s winter.”

Jeannie squints at them over her coffee. “How do you *know* that.”

Ashley shrugs. “That’s just how it is.”

Lewis nods. “Continuity.”

Jeannie sighs. “Y’all talk like you’re givin’ directions to someplace I’ve never been.”

“That’s ‘cause you have,” Ashley says, cheerful. “Just… not with us.”

Their dreams aren’t fragments.

They’re *places*.

Ashley can walk through the same woods night after night and recognize which paths are safe. She knows where the light changes. Where the air feels heavier. Where she shouldn’t linger too long.

Sometimes she dreams of a mansion.

It doesn’t resemble anything real — not the house her grandparents actually lived in — but it feels like them. Long hallways. Warm wood. Rooms that hold memories she doesn’t consciously remember having.

She always wakes up knowing it matters.

Lewis dreams in systems.

Cities with rules. Technology that doesn’t exist but works consistently. Characters who remember him even if *he* forgets them for a while.

He writes everything down.

Dates. Locations. Diagrams.

Ashley does too — less obsessively, more intuitively — but between them, there are notebooks full of worlds that never reset.

Eric dreams differently.

Less often. Less controllably.

But when he does, they linger.

He doesn’t call them lucid dreams. He calls them *messages*.

Visions heavy with symbolism. Familiar faces standing in places that don’t exist. Warnings. Comforts. Moments that feel… *weighted*.

“These ain’t just dreams,” he says quietly when Lewis presses him.

Lewis respects that.

Ashley does too.

Eric doesn’t document his dreams the way they do. He prays about them. Sits with them. Asks what they mean instead of trying to steer them.

And sometimes, when Ashley describes something strange she saw while dreaming — a light, a voice, a sense of being watched — Eric goes still.

“Yeah,” he says. “I’ve seen somethin’ like that.”

Jeannie hates these conversations.

Not because she thinks they’re nonsense — but because she can’t *track* them.

Y’all jump around,” she says, rubbing her temples. “You’re talkin’ about a staircase, then a flood, then a man with no face, and somehow it’s all the same story.”

Lewis opens his mouth to explain.

She holds up a hand. “Don’t.”

Eric chuckles. “She just ain’t got the map.”

“I don’t want the map,” Jeannie says. “I want y’all to talk like normal people.”

Ashley grins. “We are.”

---

At night, when the house is quiet, Ashley sometimes lies awake thinking about the mansion.

About why her mind built it. About what it holds that she hasn’t unlocked yet.

Lewis, in his room, is probably adding another note to an ever-growing document.

Eric is praying.

Jeannie is sleeping soundly, grateful for that.

Different minds.
Different meanings.
Same family.

And in the morning, they’ll all wake up in the same place — carrying worlds no one else can see, but learning to live together anyway.
