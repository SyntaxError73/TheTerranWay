### **Morning Questions**

Ashley was halfway through her usual route when she heard it.

“Whoa.”

She slowed automatically, breath steady, tail flicking as she glanced toward the sound. A group of kids stood clustered in a front yard, bikes dropped haphazardly in the grass, all of them staring at her like she’d just walked out of a cartoon.

One of them waved.

“Hey!”

Ashley jogged in place for a second, then stopped near the fence. “Mornin’.”

There was a brief, intense whisper conference among the kids.

Then one spoke up, clearly elected as spokesperson.

“…Can we put a saddle on you and ride you like a horse?”

Ashley stared.

Just for a moment.

Not angry. Not shocked. Just processing the sheer *boldness* of it.

“…No,” she said flatly.

The kids deflated immediately.

Then she sighed, rubbing the back of her neck. “I ain’t a horse. And even if I was, you’re supposed to ask real polite first.”

A few of them laughed, embarrassed. One kid kicked at the grass. “Sorry. You just look really fast.”

That took the edge off.

Ashley snorted. “That part’s true.”

Another kid squinted. “Do you bite?”

“Only bad ideas,” Ashley replied.

That got a grin.

She took a step back onto the road, stretching her arms. “Y’all have fun. And maybe don’t ask strangers if you can ride ‘em.”

“Yes ma’am,” one kid said solemnly.

Ashley jogged off again, shaking her head, half amused, half exasperated.

“Lord,” she muttered to herself, “kids are somethin’ else.”

By the time she rounded the corner, she was smiling.

Annoying?

Yeah.

But also… kind of funny.

And honestly?

At least they’d asked.
