### **The Big Fixer-upper**

Eric didn’t plan to start doing commissions.

It just… happened.

Someone from church mentioned a loose step. Eric fixed it after service without making a thing of it. Another person asked if he could look at a door that wouldn’t shut right. Then a neighbor heard about the shelving he’d built for a friend and wondered if he could do something similar.

Word spread the way it always did in small towns—quietly, kindly.

Eric found himself spending a few days a week driving out to other people’s homes, toolboxes rattling in the back, sleeves rolled up, mind settling into that calm, focused place he liked best.

Every house was different.

Some were old and creaky, floors slanted just enough that you had to compensate without commenting on it. Some were newer, but rushed—corners cut, things installed without care. Eric noticed everything, but he didn’t judge.

He just fixed what he could.

He rebuilt a sagging porch rail for an elderly couple who insisted on feeding him lunch afterward. He reinforced a pantry shelf that had been threatening to collapse under canned goods for years. He repaired a window frame so cleanly the homeowner blinked and said, “It hasn’t opened that smooth since we moved in.”

Eric nodded. “Wood remembers,” he said simply.

People watched him work sometimes. Not because they didn’t trust him—but because they felt calmer when he was there. He moved with intention. Measured twice. Cleaned as he went. Explained things if asked, never if not.

He charged fairly. Sometimes less than he should have.

When someone tried to overpay him, he’d shake his head. “That ain’t necessary.”

When someone tried to apologize for their house being messy or small or worn, he’d respond gently, “Houses are for livin’. You’re doin’ it right.”

One afternoon, while repairing a set of stairs, a homeowner asked him why he didn’t go into contracting full-time.

Eric paused, hammer resting against his thigh.

“…I like keepin’ it small,” he said. “Lets me do it right.”

That was the truth.

He liked knowing where his work went. Liked seeing the relief on someone’s face when a long-ignored problem stopped being a threat. Liked leaving a place better than he found it without leaving himself behind in the process.

At home, Ashley would inspect his hands when he got back—scratches, sawdust still clinging to his skin.

“You build today?” she’d ask.

“Yeah,” he’d say.

“Good build?”

He’d nod. “Good build.”

Lewis teased him about becoming a local cryptid—*the giant who fixes things and vanishes*. John bragged about him to anyone who would listen. Jeannie worried he worked too hard, then packed him leftovers anyway.

Eric took the commissions for a while.

Long enough to help people.
Long enough to prove to himself that his hands could build stability—not just for his family, but for others too.

And when he eventually slowed down, took fewer jobs, said no more often?

People understood.

Because Eric had never sold himself as anything more than what he was:

Someone who showed up.
Did solid work.
And left things stronger than before.
