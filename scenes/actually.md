### **Actually, It Makes Sense If You Think About It**

They rediscovered it by accident.

Lewis was scrolling through old notes when he froze.

“…Ashley.”

She looked up immediately. “What.”

“I found the document.”

Her eyes widened. “The *document*?”

“The one about the gravity-offended grass world.”

Ashley scrambled over, peering at the screen. “Oh my god. We never finished this.”

Lewis scrolled. “We absolutely did not.”

They sat in silence for a moment, rereading fragments.

“Petty terrain.”
“Mandatory hats.”
“Oceans lie.”

Ashley nodded thoughtfully. “Still holds up.”

Lewis frowned. “But it doesn’t have a unifying framework.”

Ashley squinted at him. “You’re about to make this worse, ain’t you.”

Lewis cracked his knuckles. “Hear me out.”

---

“Fundamental elements,” Lewis said, already typing. “Three of them.”

Ashley leaned back. “Like… universe stuff?”

“Yes.”

She pointed. “If horses ain’t one of ‘em, I’m leavin’.”

Lewis didn’t even hesitate. “Horses.”

Ashley grinned. “Good start.”

Lewis continued, “Grass.”

“Obviously.”

“And fire.”

Ashley snapped her fingers. “Done.”

Lewis paused. “…Wait.”

Ashley nodded sagely. “Horses, grass, fire. Forces, matter, energy.”

Lewis stared at her. “…That’s actually good.”

“I know,” she said smugly.

---

They built from there.

“The planet rotates,” Lewis said, “because horses are running inside the mantle.”

Ashley added, “They’re very dedicated horses.”

“Friction from the running generates fire.”

“Which feeds volcanoes.”

“And volcanoes create new land,” Lewis continued, “which grows grass.”

Ashley leaned forward, eyes bright. “Which feeds the horses.”

They stared at each other.

“…It’s a closed loop,” Lewis whispered.

Ashley slapped the table. “It’s *perfect*.”

---

They expanded wildly.

Stars were sparks kicked up by celestial horses.
Black holes were places where the horses had stopped running and everything got sad.
Time moved forward because horses refused to run backward.

Lewis added diagrams.

Ashley added vibes.

At some point, Amelia wandered in and listened quietly.

“…You’re saying,” she said carefully, “that all physical phenomena can be reduced to equine motivation, photosynthesis, and combustion.”

“Yes,” Lewis said.

Ashley nodded. “In that order.”

Amelia adjusted her glasses. “…I hate that this is internally consistent.”

Primal paused in the doorway. “Why are there horses in the Earth.”

Ashley didn’t miss a beat. “They’re tryin’ their best.”

Primal considered this. “…Okay.”

---

They saved the document again.

This time labeled:

**ABSOLUTELY CANON – DO NOT QUESTION**

And every so often, weeks or months later, one of them would remember it and add a line.

A new rule.
A new exception.
A new horse.

Continuity, after all, was important.

Even in worlds that ran on grass and fire and an unreasonable number of extremely committed horses.
