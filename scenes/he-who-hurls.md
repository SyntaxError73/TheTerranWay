### He Who Hurls the Most

Oh, everyone knows that story.

Which is exactly why John never tells it anymore.

John just grins real slow whenever someone brings up “He Who Hurls the Most.”
Eric, meanwhile, goes very still — the way someone does when they’ve accepted their fate but not forgiven it.

Lewis, of course, cannot help himself.

“Oh come on,” he says. “It’s not that bad. He was sick. It happens.”

Eric glares. “You counted.”

Lewis shrugs. “For science.”

Ashley is already laughing. “Dad, you literally named him like it was an ancient prophecy.”

John holds up his hands. “I didn’t choose the title. The title chose him.”

Jeannie sighs. “I told y’all not to let him eat funnel cake, chili, and lemonade.”

Eric mutters, “I was twelve.”

“And ambitious,” John says proudly.

Ashley wipes her eyes. “You know what? Compared to Toe Claw Biter, that’s honestly dignified.”

Eric points at her. “Do not start.”

Lewis grins. “I mean, ‘He Who Hurls the Most’ sounds like a warrior.”

Eric groans. “Please stop mythologizing my gastrointestinal failure.”

Primal, quietly helpful:
“That sure is something.”

And just like that, the story is over — not explained, not detailed, not revisited.

Because some family legends are best left implied.

Especially the messy ones.
