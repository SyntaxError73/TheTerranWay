### **True Crime**



This was one of those household differences that never turned into an argument—just a quiet, well-practiced dance.
It usually started the same way.
John would be halfway through a video, phone propped up, voice low but intent. Jeannie leaned over his shoulder, brow furrowed, completely absorbed.
“…Now listen to this part,” John would say. “This is where it gets real strange.”
Ashley would freeze mid-step.
Eric would pause wherever he was standing.
They didn’t need to hear details. The tone was enough.


Ashley reacted first.
No words. No complaints.
She turned on her heel and disappeared down the hall like a ghost who had learned its escape routes well. A moment later, her door clicked shut. Headphones went on. Music came up—loud.
Not background loud.
Flood-the-brain loud.
Shoegaze, folk, something with no sharp consonants. Something where voices blurred into feeling instead of telling stories. She lay back on the bed, eyes closed, tail flicking restlessly until the sound fully swallowed her.
She hated horror. Hated true crime even more.
Not because it scared her—but because it reminded her how cruel the world could be. How easily people hurt each other. How real it all was.
She didn’t want those images living rent-free in her head.
So she drowned them.


Eric stayed longer—but not by much.
He didn’t flinch. Didn’t scowl. Just quietly redirected himself.
“Y’all mind if I step outside a bit?” he’d ask.
John barely looked up. “Go on.”
Eric slipped his boots on and stepped into the evening air, breathing deep. Sometimes he prayed. Sometimes he didn’t even use words—just stood still and let the quiet settle his chest.
If the air wasn’t enough, he went to the workshop.
Wood didn’t replay things in your dreams.
He sanded. Measured. Cut. Let his hands do something honest and grounded. Sometimes he spoke softly, not to anyone in particular.
“Lord,” he murmured once, “there’s enough darkness without invitin’ more.”
Because Eric knew what happened if he didn’t divert.
Nightmares came easily after true crime. Faces he’d never seen. Stories his mind finished for him. He woke up tense and exhausted, heart racing over things that weren’t his to carry.
So he chose not to carry them.


John and Jeannie noticed—of course they did.
They just didn’t push.
John would lower the volume sometimes, glancing down the hall. Jeannie would sigh softly, conflicted but understanding.
“Guess that stuff hits ‘em different,” she said once.
John nodded. “Yeah. Ain’t wrong.”
They didn’t stop watching. It fascinated them—patterns, psychology, unanswered questions. But they learned when to pause. When to turn it off.
When the house needed peace more than curiosity.
Later that night, Ashley would emerge again, music faded, eyes clear. Eric would come back inside smelling faintly of sawdust or night air.
No one explained themselves.
They didn’t need to.
Ashley leaned against Eric once, quiet. “Thanks for not makin’ me feel weird about it.”
He gave her a small smile. “You ain’t weird.”
She nodded. “I know. Just… glad.”
In the Hunter house, avoiding horror wasn’t weakness.
It was self-knowledge.
And everyone respected it—even if they coped in very different ways.
