### **Absolutely Not Canon**

It always started the same way.

“What if—” Lewis said.

Ashley was already grinning. “No.”

“But listen.”

She leaned back in her chair, arms crossed. “Alright. I’m listenin’. But I ain’t promisin’ approval.”

Lewis gestured dramatically. “What if there was a world where gravity only worked if you were *thinking* about it.”

Ashley snorted. “So everyone’s floatin’ around distracted.”

“Yes.”

“And the people who trip a lot are actually just overthinkers,” she added.

Lewis’s eyes lit up. “Yes! Exactly!”

Ashley sat forward now. “And the ground gets offended when you ignore it.”

Lewis gasped. “Sentient terrain.”

“Petty terrain,” Ashley corrected. “You fall once and the floor remembers.”

Lewis was typing furiously. “The grass whispers insults.”

Ashley laughed. “Mountains are passive-aggressive.”

“What about oceans?”

Ashley thought. “Oh, oceans absolutely pretend they’re calm and then pull nonsense when you’re not lookin’.”

Lewis nodded solemnly. “Canon.”

They paused, considering the chaos they’d just unleashed.

“…What do the people look like?” Lewis asked.

Ashley shrugged. “Everyone’s shaped a little wrong. On purpose.”

Lewis grinned. “Fashion makes no sense.”

“None,” Ashley agreed. “Hats are mandatory but never fit.”

Lewis added, “Currency is compliments.”

Ashley pointed at him. “No, no. *Insults.* But polite ones.”

Lewis laughed so hard his shoulder twitched. “You’re terrible.”

“I’m inspired.”

They kept going.

Every idea contradicted the last. Timelines overlapped. Rules existed only to be broken five minutes later. Nothing needed explaining, because explaining would ruin it.

Amelia wandered in at some point, listened for ten seconds, then quietly left.

Primal passed by later and paused. “…What are you doing?”

Lewis didn’t look up. “Building a world.”

Ashley added, “It’s stupid.”

Primal nodded. “Okay.”

When they finally stopped, neither of them could remember half of what they’d created.

Which was fine.

Because the point wasn’t the world.

It was the space between them — where ideas could be ridiculous, unfinished, and free.

And that was the only rule that ever mattered.
