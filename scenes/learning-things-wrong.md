### **Learning Things the Wrong Way First**

Ashley had always learned from watching.

Not asking. Not checking. Just absorbing.

If something happened in a book, or a show, or a comic, her brain filed it away as *information* — not metaphor, not exaggeration. Just data waiting to be used later.

That’s how she ended up misunderstanding things sometimes.

Lewis used to lend her manga from the big city library — stories full of action, humor, and moments that weren’t meant to be instructional. Ashley didn’t always catch that part.

So when she copied something she’d seen once — confidently, practically — she thought she was doing it *right*.

The embarrassment came later.

And it stayed longer than it deserved to.

There were other habits, too.

Chewing was one of them.

Ashley had always needed something to bite. Something with resistance. Something that pushed back just enough to feel grounding.

As a hatchling, it was her own toe claws — gnawing them down without realizing until they were dull. Rubber toys didn’t stand a chance. Seatbelts were a particular favorite, the nylon taste mixing with saliva in a way that scratched an itch deep in her brain.

It soothed her. Quieted her thoughts. Made the world feel manageable.

That’s where the nickname came from.

“My little toe claw biter,” John would say fondly.

Ashley would groan. “Dad.”

But she never argued with it.

---

She didn’t do it much anymore.

She’d learned restraint. Self-control. Awareness.

Still — sometimes, when she was tired or stressed, she’d catch herself biting at the edge of her raptorial talon, teeth worrying the tip without realizing.

She’d stop immediately.

“Can’t do that,” she’d mutter, shaking her head. “Gotta stay sharp.”

Not for fighting — not really — but for *being ready*. It was how she framed it in her mind.

Prepared. Capable. Grounded.

---

Ashley didn’t feel embarrassed by these things anymore.

She understood them.

She knew her brain took things literally. She knew her body sought comfort through pressure and texture. She knew she learned best by example — even when the example wasn’t meant to be followed.

She didn’t see it as a flaw.

Just… part of her wiring.

And these days, when she felt that old urge rise — to chew, to copy, to act before thinking — she met it with patience instead of shame.

“Okay,” she’d tell herself quietly. “I see you.”

And that was usually enough.
