### **Halfway Through the Targets**

Ashley liked the *idea* of the gun range more than the reality.

She stood beside John at the bench, ear protection on, posture solid and practiced. When she focused, she focused completely — breathing steady, stance balanced, tail still behind her. She squeezed the trigger, clean and controlled.

*Pop.*

The target jumped.

John peeked through the scope, nodded. “Good shot, Mayfly.”

She smiled, pleased. Took another. Then another.

She was good at it. That part was undeniable.

But after a while, her attention started to wander.

She glanced at the hills beyond the range fence. The treeline. The way the wind moved through the grass. A bird landed on a post and tilted its head, curious.

Ashley lowered the rifle slightly. “How many more we got?”

John checked the ammo. “Couple magazines.”

She hummed, noncommittal.

A few more shots. Still accurate. Still steady.

Then she set the rifle down and stretched her arms. “I’m gonna walk around a bit.”

John raised an eyebrow. “You bored already?”

She grinned. “I like doin’ things with you. I just don’t like doin’ *one* thing for too long.”

He chuckled. “Fair.”

Ashley wandered along the perimeter, boots crunching softly. She crouched near a patch of dirt, examining tracks. Watched ants hauling something impressive across a rock. Picked up a feather and tucked it into her pocket without thinking.

John watched her from the bench, shaking his head fondly.

That was his girl.

She came back eventually, hands dusty, eyes bright.

“You miss anything?” she asked.

John gestured toward the target. “Nah. Still where I left it.”

She laughed and picked the rifle back up, settling in beside him again. Took one more careful shot.

Bullseye.

She glanced at him, satisfied. “Alright. I’m good now.”

John smiled. “Knew you would be.”

They packed up together — shooting done, exploring accomplished, time well spent.

For Ashley, that was the perfect balance.
