### **One From Each Clutch**

On Terra, it wasn’t unusual.

Among Sauromorphs — especially those who worked the land — children weren’t planned like milestones. They were planned like seasons.

Jeannie had laid three clutches over the course of her life.

Each clutch had held multiple eggs.

And each time, she made the same choice.

One.

It wasn’t cruelty. It wasn’t loss. It was intention.

Raising a Sauromorph hatchling took time, labor, and community. On a farm, spacing mattered. Older children learned responsibility early — not as a burden, but as participation. By the time the next clutch came, the household already had capable hands, watchful eyes, and voices that could soothe a crying hatchling while adults worked.

Eric came first.

Strong, wide-framed even as a hatchling, stubborn and steady. By the time he was old enough to understand what work meant, he wanted to help. He learned by doing, by watching his parents, by being trusted with small but meaningful tasks.

Years later came Ashley.

By then, Eric was already tall enough to loom protectively over her, already strong enough to carry things that were too heavy for her. He became her shadow without realizing it — the one who made sure she didn’t wander too far, the one who silently positioned himself between her and anything unfamiliar.

Then came Lewis.

Small, curious, already watching everything with sharp eyes. By the time he hatched, Ashley was old enough to be involved — not just watching, but teaching. Showing him animals. Sitting with him while he drew. Letting him ask questions that didn’t always have answers.

Jeannie never regretted her choice.

Each child grew up with space to be seen. Each one had someone older to lean on. Each one learned early that family wasn’t about competition — it was about *continuity*.

On the farm, that spacing mattered.

And even now — displaced, scattered into a new world — it still showed.

Eric anchored.
Ashley bridged.
Lewis imagined forward.

Three siblings.

Three clutches.

One from each — chosen not out of necessity, but out of care.

And it made them exactly who they were.
