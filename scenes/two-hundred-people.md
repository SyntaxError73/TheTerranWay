### **Two Hundred People**

They didn’t expect it to blow up.

That was the first thing Jeannie said, and everyone agreed — mostly.

Lewis still checked the numbers more often than he admitted.

The channel started out of practicality more than ambition. People already talked about the Hunters. Someone always had a phone out. Rumors floated around town and online — cryptids, aliens, folklore, you name it. Ashley figured if folks were going to tell stories anyway, they might as well tell their own.

So Lewis set up the channel.

A simple name. No branding genius. Just videos.

---

The content was… them.

Ashley explaining catfish noodling like it was the most normal thing in the world.
Eric building something in the workshop, camera propped up awkwardly.
Jeannie baking and talking through whatever craft had her attention that week.
John rambling about tools, old games, and how to survive the zombie apocalypse.
Amelia occasionally appearing in the background, waving shyly or filming from behind the camera.

No clickbait. No exaggerated reactions. No yelling thumbnails.

Lewis tried, once.

Ashley vetoed it immediately.

---

The algorithm did not care.

Views trickled in. Comments were kind but sparse. Subscriptions climbed slowly and then… stopped.

Two hundred.

Lewis stared at the number one evening, refresh button untouched.

“That’s it,” he said.

Ashley peeked over his shoulder. “That’s a lotta people.”

“It’s not a lot for YouTube.”

“It’s a lot for *us*.”

He leaned back, thinking about that.

---

Eric didn’t mind at all.

“Two hundred people chose to watch,” he said. “Nobody made ‘em.”

Jeannie nodded. “That’s more than enough to talk to.”

John grinned. “I don’t gotta perform.”

Amelia left a little heart on every comment, even the awkward ones.

---

Over time, the channel settled into something comfortable.

No schedule.
No pressure.
No chasing trends.

Just little updates. Little moments.

Someone commented once:

> *I watch these when I’ve had a rough day. You all seem… real.*

Ashley read it twice.

Then she smiled.

---

They never went viral.

They never got sponsored.

They never “made it.”

But sometimes Ashley would check the channel late at night, see the same familiar usernames commenting again and again, and feel oddly grounded.

Two hundred people.

Not fans.

Just witnesses.

And that, they decided, was plenty.
