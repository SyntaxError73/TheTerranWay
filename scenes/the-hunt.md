### **The Hunt**

The woods here were different from Terra’s.

The trees were taller in a way that felt unplanned, branches crossing without intention, undergrowth allowed to tangle and reclaim. Ashley liked it. It reminded her of the ancient forests near Silver Hollow — places where the land didn’t ask permission to exist.

They moved quietly.

The shifter barely made a sound. Even his tail, bright red against the brown and green, stayed low and controlled, the tip never brushing leaves unless he meant it to. Ashley carried a rifle slung over her shoulder, safety on, hands relaxed. She wasn’t hunting today. She was *watching*.

He paused at the edge of a small clearing and lifted a hand.

Deer.

Ashley saw it a moment later — a young buck, head down, unaware. She instinctively checked the wind, habit more than thought. It wasn’t blowing toward them.

Good.

The shifter glanced back at her, silent question in his eyes.

She nodded once.

He didn’t draw a weapon. He never did.

Instead, he stepped back into the shadows and began to climb.

Ashley watched him go up the tree with practiced ease, muscles and claws working together, every movement deliberate. No haste. No excitement. Just focus. He positioned himself on a thick branch, body coiled and still, breathing slow.

Ashley didn’t flinch.

On Terra, hunting was part of life. You learned early that food came from effort, from respect, from knowing when to act and when to wait. She preferred firearms — clean, distant, controlled — but she understood this too.

The shifter waited.

When the moment came, it was over quickly.

A sudden drop. One decisive movement. No struggle. No excess.

Ashley looked away, not out of discomfort, but out of respect.

When she looked back, he was already still, head bowed slightly, a quiet acknowledgment of what had been taken. He stayed like that for a moment longer than necessary, as if listening to the forest settle again.

Only then did he straighten.

Ashley approached, boots crunching softly on leaves. She rested a hand on his shoulder — not to comfort, but to share the moment. He exhaled, tension easing from his frame.

“You hunt like you mean it,” she said finally.

He huffed a small, nervous laugh. “I don’t like wasting… anything.”

“Neither do I,” she replied. “Just different tools.”

They stood there together, the forest closing back around them, neither judging the other. Two people raised by different worlds, meeting at the same understanding:

That taking a life for sustenance wasn’t cruelty —
it was responsibility.

Later, they would process the meat carefully. Nothing would be wasted. The forest would take back what was left behind.

And Ashley would think, not for the first time, that despite the myths, despite the claws and teeth and venom —

He hunted not like a monster.

But like someone who understood exactly what the cost was.
