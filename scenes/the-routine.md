### **The Routine**

Morning came easy for Ashley.
Not because she loved mornings—but because her body decided it was time, and once that switch flipped there was no negotiating it back off.
She slid out of bed quietly, bare feet touching the cool floor, tail giving a small balancing sweep as she stood. The house was still mostly asleep, wrapped in that soft pre-dawn hush that made everything feel possible.
First stop was automatic.
Bladder first. Always.
Same timing as a human—no heroic holding, no drama—just another body doing what bodies do. Practical. Necessary. Done.
She washed her hands, splashed a little water on her face, and padded back into her room already loosening up, joints waking before her brain fully did.
Stretching came next.
This part mattered.
Ashley planted her feet wide and rolled her shoulders slowly, one at a time, feeling the familiar pops and releases along her spine. She leaned forward into a deep fold, palms flat on the floor, tail lifting naturally to counterbalance. No strain. Just length.
She flowed through it like something rehearsed:
• A long calf stretch against the wall
• Hip openers that made her sigh quietly
• A slow spinal twist, one arm reaching back, feathers settling as her torso rotated
• A deep squat, balanced easily, elbows pressing into her knees
She lifted one leg at a time, drawing it up and back, testing range, flexibility, strength. Her body responded gladly—loose, ready, alive.
By the time she stood again, she felt present.
Good.
Clothes were simple.
Tank top, definitely. She pawed through the drawer, squinting at the options like they might argue back.
Pink.
Gray.
One with a faded graphic she liked but pretended not to.
She picked the pink one without hesitation.
Breakfast came next.
Sometimes it was her own egg—scrambled, seasoned just right, eaten without a second thought. Other mornings, the kitchen already smelled warm and familiar.
If Jeannie or John had beaten her to it, she’d pause in the doorway, sniff once, and grin.
“Y’all already cookin’?” she’d ask softly.
And somehow—always—there was something she could eat without her gut protesting. Eggs, toast, something hearty and grounding. She never questioned the luck of it.
She ate standing at the counter, relaxed, tail flicking lazily.
Then came the battles.
Teeth first.
She stared at the toothbrush like it had personally offended her.
“…Alright,” she muttered. “Let’s get this over with.”
She brushed quickly, efficiently, tolerating the sensation with the same grit she applied to cold water or loud noises. Not her favorite. Not optional.
Hair next.
A few rough passes with the brush—just enough to knock the worst tangles loose—then she gathered it all up into that familiar, chaotic ponytail. Not neat. Never neat. Just functional.
Feathers got gentler treatment.
She brushed them lightly, carefully, more out of respect than necessity. Enough to smooth, not enough to overstimulate. They settled back into place, soft and orderly, catching the morning light.
Satisfied, she grabbed her shoes—carried them outside instead of putting them on yet—and stepped onto the porch.
The air was cool. Clean. Quiet.
Ashley inhaled deeply, tail lifting, muscles already humming with anticipation.
Then she started her jog—easy at first, then stronger—feet finding rhythm, breath syncing with movement, the day unfolding one stride at a time.
No shower. That was for night.
Morning was for motion.
And Ashley met it exactly the way she liked—
awake, stretched loose, a little wild, and ready to go.
