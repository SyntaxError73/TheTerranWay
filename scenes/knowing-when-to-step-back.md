### **Knowing When to Step Back**

Ashley learned it the hard way.

Not in a big, dramatic moment — just a string of small ones that added up.

A volleyball match where she slammed the ball harder than she needed to.
A footrace where losing made her jaw ache from clenching it.
A board game where she went quiet and sharp instead of laughing it off.

She didn’t throw fits. Didn’t yell.

But she *felt* it.

That hot, tight thing in her chest. The way her thoughts stopped being generous. The way winning stopped being fun and losing felt personal.

One afternoon, after a stupid little competition that didn’t matter at all, Ashley sat on the porch steps with her elbows on her knees and stared at the dirt.

“I don’t like who I am when I lose,” she said finally.

Lewis looked up from where he was fiddling with something mechanical. “You’re… intense.”

“That’s the nice word,” Ashley muttered.

Eric leaned against the railing, thoughtful. “Ain’t wrong to wanna win.”

“Yeah,” Ashley said. “But I don’t wanna be mad at folks I love just ‘cause I didn’t.”

That was it.

No vow. No dramatic decision.

She just… stopped.

She still ran — but not races.
Still lifted — but not for records.
Still played — but cooperative games, shared goals, things where nobody had to lose for her to enjoy herself.

When someone suggested a competition, she’d smile and shake her head.

“Nah,” she’d say easily. “I’m good.”

And she was.

Because Ashley didn’t quit competition out of weakness.

She quit because she knew herself well enough to choose kindness — even toward the parts of her that wanted to win a little too badly.

And that, in its own quiet way, was a victory she never regretted.
