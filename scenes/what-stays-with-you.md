### **What Stays With You**

Ashley heard it by accident.

Jeannie wasn’t trying to make a point — just talking, folding laundry, voice easy in the way it got when she was remembering something old.

“Eric scared me half to death once,” she said. “When he was younger. Swimmin’ with that church boy of his.”

Ashley paused in the doorway. “What?”

Jeannie glanced up. “Oh—did I never tell you?”

Ashley didn’t answer. Her chest felt tight.

“He got tired,” Jeannie continued, unaware. “Just… ran outta steam. His friend had to grab him and haul him back. If that boy hadn’t been there—” She shook her head. “Lord.”

Ashley sat down hard.

Eric. Tired. Helpless in the water.

The image lodged itself in her mind like a splinter.

She didn’t bring it up to him.

She never would.

But from that moment on, water changed shape in her head.

It wasn’t just about drowning anymore — it was about *watching someone else disappear*. About being too far away. Too slow. Too confident.

She started counting where everyone was when they swam. Who was closest to shore. Who looked tired. Who needed a break before they admitted it.

She floated higher.

Stayed closer.

Watched more.

Eric noticed eventually.

“You hover,” he said once, gentle. “Like you’re guardin’ somethin’.”

Ashley shrugged. “Habit.”

He studied her for a moment, then nodded. “Alright.”

He trusted her enough not to push.

---

Ashley never told anyone why she stayed on the surface.

Why she hated diving.
Why she memorized exits.
Why she thought about hooks and lines and exhaustion instead of fun.

It wasn’t because she was afraid of dying.

It was because she knew how fast strength could run out.

And if something ever happened again — to Eric, to Lewis, to anyone she loved — she wanted to already be there.

Already watching.

Already ready.

Ashley worried about her family more than herself.

Always had.

Always would.
