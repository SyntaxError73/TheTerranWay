### **Finding Footing**

Earth had rules.

Not written ones — not always — but the kind you felt pressing in from all sides. Rent. Paperwork. Schedules. The unspoken agreement that survival required productivity.

The Hunters felt it immediately.

Eric adapted first.

It wasn’t because he liked the idea of working retail — he didn’t — but because the hardware store felt familiar in a way nothing else did. Wood. Metal. Tools with honest purposes.

The manager stared for a long moment at Eric’s build, his height, his careful way of standing like he was always aware of how much space he took up.

“You ever worked construction?” the man asked.

Eric shrugged. “Farm work. Fixing things. Buildin’ what needs buildin’.”

That was enough.

Eric learned the aisles quickly. Remembered where everything went. Helped customers lift heavy things without making a show of it. He liked that the work was tangible — you came in with a problem, you left with something that fixed it.

And when a shelf wobbled, or a door hinge squeaked, or something needed muscle and patience?

Eric was already there.

He didn’t talk about work much at home.

But he slept better.

Jeannie struggled.

Not because she lacked skill — she had more creativity than most people knew what to do with — but because Earth asked for it to be *marketable*.

She tried a pottery studio. Then a small craft shop. Then a community center that hosted workshops. Each place welcomed her warmly, at first.

Then conversations stalled.

Not unkindly. Just… briefly.

Jeannie made things that were thoughtful, detailed, quiet. Things meant to be used, not displayed. She found that people admired them — but didn’t always know how to connect to her.

So she moved on. Not bitter. Just searching.

“I’ll find the right place,” she told John one evening, hands wrapped around a mug. “I always do.”

John squeezed her hand. “You always do.”

John didn’t want a job.

He wanted *ownership*.

Earth’s systems chafed at him — applications, interviews, supervisors half his age telling him how things were done. He listened politely. He smiled. But it never stuck.

What did stick was an idea.

He started small. Repairs. Odd jobs. Fixing fences. Clearing brush. Helping folks who didn’t know who else to ask. He talked to everyone. Remembered names. Remembered needs.

“Hunter’s Fix-It,” he joked at first.

Then people started calling.

John liked that kind of work. Liked being accountable only to the job and the person in front of him. Liked that his hands told the story instead of paperwork.

It wasn’t stable yet.

But it was *his*.

Ashley avoided the conversation for as long as she could.

The idea of working most of her life just to stay alive felt wrong in her bones. Terra hadn’t been like this. Even farming — even labor — had felt connected to something larger than survival.

“I’ll help,” she said. “Just… not like that.”

She took temporary work. Seasonal jobs. Trail maintenance. Survey assistance. Anything outdoors, anything short-term, anything that ended.

She liked knowing there was an end.

Ashley didn’t mind effort.

She minded *endlessness*.

Lewis minded it even more.

“I don’t wanna do this again,” he said one night, flat and honest. “I don’t wanna trade my time for money forever.”

No one argued with him.

He contributed in other ways — fixing electronics, helping Primal navigate systems, researching, planning. He made himself useful without belonging to a schedule.

For now.

They hadn’t secured a permanent home yet. Everything was provisional. Temporary. Held together by trust and shared effort.

But slowly — piece by piece — they were rebuilding something that looked like a life.

Not Earth’s version.

Their own.

And that, more than any job title, was what mattered.
