### **A System That Works**

Jeannie figured it out halfway down the produce aisle.

The cart handled better when she pushed it with her lower arms.

Not because anyone told her to — just because it made sense. The weight stayed steady, the wheels didn’t wobble, and her humanoid arms were suddenly free. Efficient. Balanced.

She rolled forward smoothly, one raptor hand on either side of the handle, posture relaxed.

With her upper hands, she reached for apples. Checked them for bruises. Turned one over thoughtfully before placing it in the cart.

“Excuse me,” a shopper murmured as they passed.

Jeannie smiled automatically. “Go right on.”

Nobody stared for long. A glance, maybe — then they moved on. That suited her just fine.

She navigated the aisles like she’d been doing it her whole life. Pause. Reach. Read labels. Adjust cart position with a small shift of her lower arms. She found she liked the rhythm of it — the quiet problem-solving of daily life.

At the canned goods, she stacked carefully. At the bakery, she lingered a moment too long.

Chocolate chip cookies.

She sighed, then put two boxes in the cart instead of one.

“Moderation,” she muttered. “Tomorrow.”

By the time she reached checkout, the cart felt like an extension of her body — no strain, no awkwardness. Just movement.

The cashier blinked once, then smiled. “You find everything alright?”

“Yes, ma’am,” Jeannie replied pleasantly.

As she wheeled the cart away, she thought — not for the first time — that adapting didn’t always mean changing who you were.

Sometimes it just meant finding a better grip.
