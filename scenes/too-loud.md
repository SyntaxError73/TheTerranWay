### **Too Loud Without Meaning To**

It started small.

It always did.

Jeannie was at the counter, sorting groceries, moving with that familiar, efficient rhythm. Ashley leaned in the doorway, arms crossed, tail swaying lazily behind her. They were talking about something unimportant—plans, timing, who was doing what later.

Ashley answered without thinking.

“I already said I’d handle it.”

Her voice was normal to *her*. Steady. Direct.

Jeannie froze.

“There’s no need to snap at me,” she said, turning slowly.

Ashley blinked. “I wasn’t—”

“Yes you were,” Jeannie replied, sharper now. “You don’t have to talk to me like that.”

Ashley’s stomach dropped.

“I swear I wasn’t,” she said quickly, already trying to pull it back, already feeling the familiar heat creep up her chest. “That’s just how I talk. I ain’t mad.”

“Well it sure sounds like you are,” Jeannie said.

Ashley exhaled, forced herself to slow down. “Mama, listen. I’m calm. I promise. I just—”

Her voice lifted again without her noticing.

Jeannie’s jaw tightened. “There it is again.”

Ashley felt it slipping.

That awful sensation of trying to explain while the ground shifted under her feet. Every sentence she reached for came out wrong. Too loud. Too firm. Too much.

“I am *trying* to tell you—” she started.

“Lower your voice,” Jeannie snapped.

“I don’t know how to make it quieter without not bein’ me!” Ashley shot back, feathers bristling despite herself.

The room felt too small. Too tight.

She stepped back, hands curling into fists. “I’m not angry! I’m just—why won’t you *hear* me?”

Jeannie’s voice rose too now. “Because you’re yelling at me in my own house!”

That was it.

Something in Ashley cracked.

---

“DAMMIT,” she burst out, pacing now, claws clicking against the floor. “Every time I open my damn mouth it’s wrong! I try to explain, I try to calm it down, and it just—SHIT!”

The words tasted awful even as she said them. Burned her throat.

Eric appeared instantly, like he’d been summoned by the sound.

“Ashley,” he said, firm. Disappointed. “Watch it.”

She stopped mid-step.

Her chest heaved. Eyes bright. Jaw trembling.

“I hate this,” she said, voice breaking. “I hate that I can’t fix it. I hate that I’m always the problem.”

Jeannie looked stricken now, anger giving way to something closer to regret—but the damage was already done.

Ashley dragged a hand down her face. “I don’t even talk like that,” she muttered. “I don’t swear. Not like that.”

Eric stepped closer, lowering his voice. “I know. That’s how I know you’re overwhelmed.”

She sank onto a chair, feathers slowly flattening, energy draining out of her all at once.

“I’m sorry,” she said quietly. Not looking at either of them. “I didn’t mean any of it like that.”

Jeannie hesitated, then nodded. “I shouldn’t have escalated.”

Ashley swallowed. “I just… need people to believe me when I say I’m calm.”

Eric rested a hand on her shoulder. Solid. Grounding.

“I do,” he said. “Even when you’re loud.”

Ashley huffed a tired, humorless laugh. “Yeah. Guess that’s my curse.”

She didn’t swear again.

The fit burned itself out as quickly as it came—leaving behind that familiar ache of wanting to be understood without having to translate herself every time.

And tomorrow, she’d try again.

Because that’s what she always did.
