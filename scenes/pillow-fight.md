### **Pillow Fight**

Ashley was dead to the world.

Sprawled on the couch. One arm dangling. Tail limp. Feathers slightly puffed in that *do not disturb unless you want consequences* way.

Then—

“HEY CRASHLEY! WAKE UP!”

*WHUMP.*

A couch pillow hit her square in the face with the confidence of a major league pitcher.

There was a half-second of silence.

Then one green eye cracked open.

Lewis stood a few feet away, already grinning, hands clasped behind his back like a villain who had rehearsed this moment.

“…You done messed up,” Ashley muttered.

She grabbed the pillow and hurled it back with intent—shoulders twisting, full follow-through, absolutely not holding back.

Lewis moved like he’d seen this coming in a dream.

Blocked.
Pivot.
Snatched it mid-air.

In one smooth motion, he flung it right back at her face.

*WHUMP.*

Ashley yelped, more offended than hurt. “HEY—!”

Lewis adjusted imaginary glasses. “Pattern recognized.”

“Oh you think you’re smart,” she growled, rolling off the couch in one fluid, feral motion. “I’ll show you smart.”

She lunged.

Lewis backpedaled just enough, laughing, lanky limbs moving with surprising strength. Ashley tried to grab him—missed—tripped slightly over her own momentum, which only fueled her laughter.

“COME HERE,” she squealed, absolutely delighted.

Lewis seized another pillow and started pummeling her as she advanced, each hit playful but relentless.

“STAY DOWN,” he announced dramatically.

Ashley collapsed to her knees, laughing so hard she could barely breathe, arms over her head as she shielded her face. “YOU CHEATER—!”

That’s when the floor shook.

“INCOMING.”

Eric came out of nowhere.

Full charge. No hesitation. Football build, perfect timing.

He body-slammed both of them in one decisive motion.

The pile went down.

Pillows flew. Someone yelped. Someone else wheezed with laughter.

“ERIC—!”
“WHAT THE—!”
“I WAS WINNING—!”

John leaned in from the doorway, arms crossed, watching the chaos unfold with deep satisfaction.

“And here we see the classic sibling pileup,” he narrated. “Notice the poor coordination, high morale, zero survival instincts—”

Jeannie walked past, paused, and sighed.

“I raised adults,” she said flatly. “Supposedly.”

None of them heard her.

Ashley was still laughing, breathless, feathers everywhere, pinned under a brother twice her mass and another with a pillow raised like a ceremonial weapon.

“Worth it,” she gasped.

Lewis grinned down at her. “Always is.”

Eric finally rolled off, chuckling, and offered Ashley a hand up like this was all perfectly normal.

John clapped once. “Alright, alright. Somebody’s gonna break somethin’ if y’all keep this up.”

Ashley flopped back onto the couch immediately, reclaiming her original position like nothing had happened.

Crashley, once again, at rest.

Lewis shook his head fondly. “You crash *everywhere*.”

She smirked, eyes already closing. “It’s a talent.”

And honestly?

The house wouldn’t have known what to do without it.
