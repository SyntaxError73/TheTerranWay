### **No Shortcut Today**

Ashley had taken this path a hundred times.

That was the problem.

The sun was already sinking lower than she liked, light slanting through the trees in long, broken bars. She’d misjudged the time — easy to do when you were tracking creek bends and deer trails instead of clocks — and now the temperature was dropping fast.

She needed to get home.

Fast.

The long way meant another forty minutes at least. The shortcut cut that in half.

Ashley stopped at the edge of the thicket, chest rising and falling steadily as she assessed it. Dense. Thorn-heavy. Wet leaves layered over uneven ground. She could push through. She always could.

But her pack felt heavier tonight. Her leg ached faintly where she’d twisted it earlier — nothing serious, but enough to matter if she slipped.

She clicked her tongue and muttered, “Ain’t this just the way.”

A rustle deeper in the brush made her head snap up.

Not prey.

Something larger. Moving wrong.

Ashley’s posture shifted instantly, all humor draining away. Her accent thickened, words slowing as she focused. “Alright now,” she whispered, hand drifting toward the knife at her belt. “I see you. Don’t you start none.”

The brush rustled again — closer this time — and her instincts flared hot and sharp. She took one careful step back, eyes scanning, weight balanced.

This wasn’t a *fight* situation.

This was a *don’t be stupid* situation.

She exhaled through her teeth. “Nope. Mm-mm. Not today, darlin’.”

Another sound — a crack of branch, too heavy to be just wind.

Ashley backed away from the thicket completely, slow and deliberate. “You can have it,” she murmured. “Shortcut’s yours.”

Once she was clear, she turned and picked up speed along the main trail, boots thudding solidly against packed earth. Her heart pounded, but her movements stayed controlled. She didn’t run — not until the trees opened up and the path widened.

Only then did she let out a shaky laugh. “Well, I’ll be.”

By the time she reached home, dusk had settled fully. She came in quieter than usual, shutting the door behind her with care.

Primal looked up from where he was sorting supplies and immediately read her body language.

“Something almost went wrong,” he said.

Ashley nodded, setting her pack down. “Yep.”

“You took the long way back,” he observed.

“Sure did.” She rubbed the back of her neck, feathers settling slowly as the adrenaline faded. “Shortcut wasn’t worth the risk this time.”

He studied her for a moment, then smiled — not relieved, not alarmed. Proud.

“That was the right call.”

She grinned, tired but genuine. “Reckon it was.”

Later, as she peeled off her jacket and checked herself for scrapes — fewer than usual — Ashley paused, thoughtful.

Shortcuts were fun.

But knowing when *not* to take one?

That was experience talking.

And experience, she’d learned, was just another kind of survival.
