### **Shed**

Amelia hated shed.

Not because it hurt — it didn’t, not really — but because everything felt *off*. Her scales dulled first, losing their soft sheen like someone had turned the saturation down on the world. Her skin felt tight in places, itchy in others. Beneath it all, her body hummed with a low, constant irritation she couldn’t quite escape.

Hormones didn’t care about implants.
Cycles didn’t ask permission.

She lay curled on the couch, tail tucked close, blanket pulled up to her shoulders even though she wasn’t cold. The air felt wrong. The light felt wrong. Even the sound of someone moving in the kitchen felt unnecessarily loud.

Ashley noticed within minutes.

“You’re being venomous,” Ashley said gently, not accusing — just factual.

Amelia hissed under her breath. Not literally. Mostly.
“I am *fine*.”

Ashley snorted. “You just called the kettle ‘judgmental.’”

“That thing *is* judging me,” Amelia muttered.

Ashley crossed the room and crouched beside her, lowering herself to Amelia’s level. “Okay. Shed-brain. You need water, something soft, and a nap. In that order.”

Amelia glared at her. Then looked away. Then, very quietly, said, “I don’t want to nap.”

Ashley smiled, fond and unsurprised. “You never do.”

She tugged the blanket higher, then stood. “I’m making soup. Don’t bite anyone. I’ll be back.”

Amelia didn’t respond. But she didn’t protest either.

Primal had been hovering near the doorway, unsure, tail curled tight to his leg. He’d sensed the shift immediately — the way Amelia’s presence felt sharper around the edges, like walking too close to glass.

“She’s… not angry with us,” Ashley said softly as she passed him. “Just uncomfortable. Shed does that to her.”

He nodded, absorbing this with the seriousness he gave everything. “What helps?”

Ashley paused. Thought. “Consistency. Gentleness. No sudden attention. And don’t take it personally if she snaps.”

Primal nodded again — then hesitated. “Can I… try something?”

Ashley smiled. “You’re good at trying things carefully. Go ahead.”

He approached Amelia slowly, deliberately. She noticed immediately, eyes narrowing.

“What,” she said flatly.

Primal stopped a respectful distance away. “I brought you something.”

He set a small object on the table beside her — a smooth stone, dark and warm, veins of faint color running through it like frozen lightning.

“It holds heat,” he explained. “I found it near the creek. You can put it against your scales. It might help with the tightness.”

Amelia stared at it. Then at him.

“…You didn’t have to,” she said, which in her current state meant *Why are you doing this and how dare you be kind about it*.

“I wanted to,” he replied simply.

She huffed, irritated — and then, against her will, her expression softened just a fraction. She reached out, pulled the stone closer, and rested it against her side.

“…It *does* help,” she admitted grudgingly.

Primal relaxed a little.

He lingered, uncertain, then added, “Ashley says you like compliments when you pretend you don’t.”

Amelia’s eyes snapped back to him. “She *what*—”

“You look… very dignified,” he said quickly, flushing. “Even like this. And your scales will shine again. They always do.”

She froze.

The irritation didn’t vanish — but it wobbled, like something knocked slightly off balance. Her ears warmed. She turned her face away.

“…You’re embarrassing,” she muttered.

But she didn’t tell him to leave.

Ashley watched from the kitchen doorway, smiling into her mug.

Later, Amelia would sleep — deeply, finally — curled up with the warm stone tucked against her side, soup cooling on the table nearby. And when she woke, the edge would be gone. The world would feel manageable again.

Shed passed.

It always did.

And this time, she’d remember — dimly, reluctantly — that being cared for didn’t make her weak.

It just meant she wasn’t alone.
