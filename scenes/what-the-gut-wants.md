### **What the Gut Says it Wants**

Ashley stood in front of the refrigerator with the door open, light spilling over her bare feet and the tiled floor.

She stared.

Not because she was picky.

Because her body was saying **no** to everything in front of her.

Leftover chicken?
No.
Sandwich stuff?
Absolutely not.
Yogurt?
Wrong.
Too cold.
Too sour.
Too *not today*.

Her gut twisted just thinking about forcing it.

If she ate something her body didn’t want, she knew what would happen. Nausea. Cramping. That heavy, miserable feeling like she’d betrayed herself.

So she didn’t.

She closed the fridge.

Opened it again.

Stared harder, like the right food might manifest if she concentrated enough.

“There’s no food in this house,” she announced.

John, at the stove, didn’t even turn around. “There’s a *lot* of food in this house.”

Ashley crossed her arms, tail flicking irritably. “There’s no food my *body* will accept.”

“That’s different,” he conceded. “How ‘bout a sandwich?”

“No.”

“Soup?”

“No.”

“Eggs?”

Her stomach rolled just a little. “Definitely no.”

John finally looked over at her, reading her posture instead of her words. “You tired?”

“…Yeah.”

That explained a lot.

Ashley loved seafood. Her body loved seafood. Shrimp especially—easy protein, comforting, familiar. On Terra, that would’ve meant effort. Planning. Cleaning. Cooking.

Here on Earth?

Frozen microwave dinners.

She still couldn’t believe they existed.

Whole meals.
Ready in minutes.
No energy required.

Shrimp pasta had become her lifeline for a while—creamy sauces, predictable textures, nothing her gut would fight.

She’d eaten through them fast.

Too fast.

Now the freezer was empty of the *good* stuff.

She leaned her forehead briefly against the fridge door. “…Dang it.”

John chuckled softly. “You want me to cook?”

Ashley hesitated. Sometimes the answer was yes. Sometimes even the idea of food made her tired.

“I dunno yet,” she said honestly.

She wandered off, thinking.

Ten minutes later, she reappeared with her phone in hand. “I’m ordering pizza.”

John raised an eyebrow. “What kind?”

“White pizza,” she said immediately. “No tomatoes. Ever.”

“Good,” he agreed solemnly.

“Alfredo sauce. Mushrooms.”

“How many?”

“…Extra.”

He nodded. “Hot sauce?”

“Yes.”

John smiled. “You’re payin’?”

Ashley nodded. “Yeah.”

“Then I support this decision fully.”

---

Sometimes, it went differently.

Sometimes John *did* cook—something incredible that hit exactly right without her asking. Something warm and grounding that made her body say yes before her brain could get in the way.

Sometimes she’d wander into the kitchen complaining about the absence of food, only to find Jeannie already stirring a pot.

“Oh,” Ashley said, startled. “…What’s that?”

“Chili,” Jeannie replied casually.

Ashley’s gut perked up instantly.

“…I love you.”

Jeannie smiled. “I know.”

Ashley never starved herself.

Not because she forced anything.

But because, somehow, it always worked out.

Her body led.
Her family listened.
And the right food—eventually—always appeared.

Even if it took staring into the refrigerator like it owed her answers first.
