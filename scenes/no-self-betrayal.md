### **Not Turning Her Back on Herself**

Ashley learned early that the worst kind of pain wasn’t being misunderstood.

It was betraying herself to avoid it.

She could survive insults. She could survive being talked over, dismissed, laughed at. What she couldn’t survive was the hollow feeling that came from changing who she was just to keep the peace — because that felt like breaking a promise she’d made long before she had words for it.

So she didn’t.

---

When she’s attacked online, she doesn’t fight back.

Not because she agrees.
Not because it doesn’t hurt.

But because she knows herself well enough to know that arguing won’t make her feel stronger — only louder in a way that isn’t *hers*.

She closes the tab. Logs out. Sets the phone down with hands that shake just a little.

Then she cries.

Alone, first — letting it pass through her instead of hardening inside her — and later with Eric, when she’s ready to be seen. He doesn’t fix it. He doesn’t tell her she’s wrong or right.

He just listens.

And that’s enough.

---

Ashley believes in being the change she wants to see — not because it’s easy, but because it’s *honest*.

She never insults people back. Never tears someone down the way she’s been torn down. Even when she’s been betrayed — even when friendships end quietly, painfully, without closure — she refuses to let that bitterness decide who she becomes.

It hurts every time.

But she stays.

---

Sometimes, though, the world hears her wrong.

Her voice is loud. Always has been. It carries without effort, firm and direct, shaped by open land and big lungs and a lifetime of being unafraid to exist.

She knows it sounds aggressive to some people.

She’s tried softening it — lowering her volume, choosing her words more carefully — but when she pushes too far in that direction, she feels that familiar wrongness again. Like she’s shrinking herself to fit a space she was never meant to occupy.

So she adjusts *a little*.

And forgives herself for the rest.

---

Ashley is self-aware enough to know her flaws.
Strong enough to work on them.
And brave enough to not erase herself in the process.

She’s lost people she loved.

She’s been misunderstood more times than she can count.

But through all of it, she’s held onto one thing without compromise:

She never turns her back on herself.

And that quiet loyalty — to her own values, her own voice, her own way of being — is what makes her strong in the ways that matter most.
