### **Titles Earned Fair and Square**

Ashley didn’t *receive* her nicknames.

She **earned** them.

John would be the first to tell you that.

They were sitting on the porch one evening, the light low and golden, when John clapped a hand on her shoulder and said, loud as ever,
“Y’know, Mayfly, you didn’t come by that name honest.”

Ashley groaned immediately. “Dad.”

“Oh no,” he continued, delighted. “You absolutely did.”

Jeannie smiled into her tea. Eric braced himself. Lewis perked up like this was a documentary he’d already memorized.

John leaned back. “Take *My Little Toe Claw Biter*, for instance.”

Ashley covered her face. “We are *not* talkin’ about that.”

“Oh, we absolutely are.”

---

She’d been tiny. Barely steady. All teeth and curiosity.

John had been sitting on the floor, fixing something unimportant, when he felt a sharp nip on his sock-covered toe.

Not hard. Just… exploratory.

He looked down to see a hatchling Ashley, eyes wide, head tilted, clearly evaluating whether toes were edible.

“She bit me,” John said proudly. “Just like that. Like she was takin’ notes.”

Ashley peeked through her fingers. “I was a *baby*.”

“You were a menace,” he corrected.

Lewis nodded. “Predatory testing behavior.”

---

Then there was **Greensleeves**.

Ashley grimaced. “I just liked plants.”

“You *ate* the plants,” Eric said helpfully.

As a hatchling, Ashley had once crawled through the garden and emerged with leaves stuck to her face, tail, and—somehow—inside her mouth.

John had laughed so hard he cried.
“She looked like a salad that fought back.”

Ashley snorted despite herself. “I was hungry!”

---

**Mud Champion** came next.

Jeannie sighed fondly. “She disappeared for ten minutes.”

They found her asleep in a puddle, covered head to tail in mud, snoring softly like she’d achieved enlightenment.

John had scooped her up without hesitation.
“Raised her right,” he’d said.

---

Ashley listened to all of it now, older, taller, unbothered.

“Dad,” she said again, shaking her head. Not angry. Never angry. Just… amused resignation.

John grinned. “You grew outta the habits. Names just stuck.”

Ashley shrugged. “Could be worse.”

Lewis smirked. “He could call you *Egg Incident Two*.”

John pointed at him. “Don’t give me ideas.”

Ashley laughed, warm and easy. She’d long since made peace with her titles.

They weren’t insults.

They were proof.

Proof she’d been loved when she was small and strange and messy. Proof someone had watched her grow and remembered *all* of it. Proof that even her grossest moments had been met with laughter, not shame.

So when John slung an arm around her and said,
“C’mon, Toe Claw Biter,”

Ashley just rolled her eyes and smiled.

“Dad.”

And that was enough.
