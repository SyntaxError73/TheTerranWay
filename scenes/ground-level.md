### **Ground Level**

Amelia hated stairs.

Not in a dramatic way. Not in a *this is my tragic flaw* kind of way.

She hated them the same way someone hated a chipped tooth or a buzzing light — because they were always there, and they always required more thought than they should.

She paused at the base of the steps outside the café, tail coiled neatly behind her, glasses slipping just a little as she craned her neck upward. Three shallow steps. A handrail that was more decorative than helpful. People passing behind her, polite but impatient.

“…Okay,” she murmured to herself. “We’re not doing that.”

She checked her phone.

Ramp entrance around back.

Of course.

The ramp was always around back.

She circled the building carefully, keeping close to the wall, tail sliding over concrete with a faint whisper. She was good at not slithering too *much* in public — at keeping movements contained, deliberate, socially acceptable — but it took effort. Constant awareness. Every turn calculated so she wouldn’t clip a doorway or knock into a trash can or become *the spectacle*.

By the time she reached the ramp, her shoulders already felt tight.

Inside, she ordered coffee and waited near the wall, making herself small. The barista smiled kindly. People were nice, usually. That almost made it harder — because she didn’t want kindness. She wanted *normal*.

When she left, she didn’t even look at the stairs again.

Getting around town required planning.

Amelia didn’t drive. She never would. The idea of pedals and seats and mirrors designed for legs she didn’t have was laughable at best and dangerous at worst.

So she took taxis.

She knew the routes better than most drivers. Knew which buildings had ramps, which sidewalks dipped too steeply, which crosswalks were smooth enough not to jar her spine. She timed errands around when she had the energy to compensate for everything else.

Sometimes she watched people climb stairs without thinking and felt something twist in her chest — not envy, exactly. Just a quiet grief for effort she would always have to spend.

At home, she let herself be clumsy.

She bumped into table legs. Misjudged turns. Knocked things over with her tail and sighed as she cleaned them up.

“Sorry,” she muttered to the furniture out of habit.

Ashley noticed, of course.

“You don’t gotta apologize to the couch,” Ashley said once, gentle but firm.

Amelia smiled faintly. “It knows what it did.”

Primal noticed too — not in words, but in action. He positioned chairs wider. Chose places with ramps without mentioning it. Walked at her pace without slowing *for* her.

That mattered more than anything.

Some days were better than others.

Some days Amelia felt capable, even graceful, navigating the world on her own terms.

Other days, stairs felt like personal insults, and the city felt like it had been designed by someone who forgot she existed.

On those days, she ordered in. Took a nap. Let herself be horizontal without guilt.

She reminded herself — quietly — that needing accommodations didn’t make her weak.

It just meant the world wasn’t built with everyone in mind.

And she was allowed to take up space anyway.
