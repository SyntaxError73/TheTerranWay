### **Looping Tracks**

Jeannie doesn’t mention it at first.

She just hums.

Softly. Absentmindedly. The same few bars, over and over, while she folds laundry. While she rinses a mug. While she stands at the window and watches nothing in particular.

Ashley notices on the third repetition.

“…You stuck?” she asks gently.

Jeannie blinks. “Hm?”

“That song,” Ashley says. “You’re loopin’.”

Jeannie exhales with a little laugh. “Oh. Yeah. It’s been in there since this mornin’.”

Lewis looks up from his phone. “Which one.”

Jeannie hums it again, a little clearer this time.

Ashley’s eyes soften immediately. “Ohhh. *That* one.”

Eric nods. “You like that song.”

“I do,” Jeannie says. “But it won’t finish. It just keeps startin’ over.”

John grins. “Means your brain’s usin’ it as wallpaper.”

Jeannie rolls her eyes affectionately. “Well I wish it’d redecorate.”

Ashley sits beside her. “Is it botherin’ you, or just… there?”

Jeannie considers. “Just there. Kinda comforting, honestly.”

Ashley smiles. “That’s okay then.”

Lewis tilts his head. “You want help gettin’ it unstuck?”

Jeannie shakes her head. “No, honey. I think it’ll pass when it’s ready.”

She hums it again without realizing she’s doing it.

John reaches over and squeezes her hand. “You’re allowed to have a soundtrack.”

Jeannie laughs quietly. “I suppose I am.”

The song keeps looping through the afternoon—not loud, not intrusive. Just a gentle thread running under everything she does.

And nobody rushes her to turn it off.

Because in the Hunter house, sometimes a song stuck in your head isn’t a problem.

It’s just your mind holding onto something that feels nice a little longer.
