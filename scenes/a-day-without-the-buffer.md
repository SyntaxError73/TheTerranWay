### **A Day Without the Buffer**

Lewis realized it before breakfast.

Not because anything was *wrong* — but because *everything* was loud.

The light coming through the window felt too sharp. The hum of the fridge was suddenly a conversation he couldn’t stop listening to. His thoughts didn’t line up anymore; they overlapped, tangled, tripped over each other like excited dogs in a hallway.

He sat at the table, spoon hovering over his bowl.

*Did I feed the chickens?*
*No, that was yesterday.*
*What if yesterday wasn’t actually yesterday?*
*Why does time feel slippery today?*

He blinked. His shoulder twitched.

“Oh,” he murmured. “Right.”

No medication.

Ashley noticed when he didn’t finish his food.

“You good?” she asked.

Lewis nodded automatically. “Yeah. Totally.”

He wasn’t.

He tried to open his laptop and immediately opened six tabs instead. Closed three. Forgot why he’d opened the rest. Started typing something, stopped mid-sentence, then stared at the cursor like it had personally betrayed him.

His thoughts sprinted without direction.

*Weather patterns.*
*That weird bug he saw last summer.*
*What if Terra’s moons affected migration?*
*Did he ever text that guy back?*
*What if the sun exploded—*

He slumped back in his chair.

“I’m tired,” he said out loud.

He’d been awake for two hours.

By midday, the exhaustion set in — not physical, exactly, but *mental*. Like his brain was running at full speed with no traction.

Every sound demanded attention. Every idea wanted to be finished *now*. None of them stayed long enough to be useful.

Amelia found him on the couch, staring at nothing.

“You look… fried,” she said gently.

Lewis laughed weakly. “My brain’s a pinball machine and someone tilted it.”

She handed him a blanket without asking.

He didn’t sleep — he couldn’t — but he rested. Sort of. His thoughts kept looping, replaying fragments of conversations, imaginary scenarios, half-formed ideas.

Primal passed by and paused.

“How are you doing?” he asked.

Lewis hesitated.
Then answered honestly. “Overstimulated. Underpowered.”

Primal nodded. “Yeah.”

That helped more than it should’ve.

By evening, Lewis felt like he’d run a marathon without moving.

His shoulders twitched more. His focus shattered faster. Even joking took effort.

“I hate this,” he admitted quietly to Ashley when she sat beside him.

“I know,” she said. “You don’t gotta be productive today.”

Lewis exhaled. “Feels like I’m lazy.”

Ashley shook her head immediately. “Nope. Your brain’s just doin’ everything at once.”

He closed his eyes, relief washing through him at being understood.

When he finally lay down that night, sleep came fast — not because his mind was calm, but because it had burned itself out.

Tomorrow would be easier.

Today had just been… loud.

And that was enough.
