### **Pontoon**

The pontoon boat bobbed lazily at the dock, metal railings warm under the sun, fishing rods clinking softly as they were loaded in.

Amelia was already regretting this.

She sat very carefully on one of the bench seats, hands folded in her lap, tail tucked as neatly as it could be in a space that was very clearly not designed for lamias. The water rocked just enough to make her stomach feel like it was reconsidering its life choices.

Ashley noticed immediately.

“You alright there, sugar?” she asked, voice easy, accent thickened by the sun and the company. “You look like you’re fixin’ to pass judgment on the concept of boats.”

“I *am* passing judgment,” Amelia muttered. “It’s not favorable.”

John laughed loudly from the helm, already settling in like he’d been born on the water. “She’ll be fine! This ol’ thing rides smoother’n a porch swing.”

Amelia closed her eyes. “That sentence has never reassured anyone.”

Jeannie climbed aboard next, basket of snacks tucked under one arm, calm and composed as always. She took one look at Amelia and set a bottle of water gently beside her. “Sip slow, honey. And don’t fight the motion.”

Amelia eyed her suspiciously. “You say that like you’ve seen this before.”

Jeannie smiled knowingly. “I’ve raised four Sauromorphs. I’ve seen everything.”

Lewis bounced on board after her, nearly tripping over a cooler. “Is this seat okay? Or am I gonna accidentally sit on someone’s tail again?”

“Again?” Amelia echoed.

Eric followed last, steadying the boat with one hand like it was nothing. “You good, Ames?” he asked gently. “We can always turn back.”

She shook her head quickly. “No. No, it’s fine. I just need to… not think about the fact that we’re floating.”

Primal stepped aboard quietly, eyes taking in everything — the rods, the water, the people. He moved carefully, tail curled close, posture polite. He nodded respectfully to each family member in turn.

“Thank you for having me,” he said.

John beamed. “Well shoot, you’re welcome anytime. Any friend of Ashley’s is family as far as we’re concerned.”

Ashley grinned, proud. “Y’all behave. This is Primal.”

Lewis leaned in, whispering loudly, “He’s got that ‘don’t worry, I brought snacks *and* first aid’ vibe.”

Primal blinked. “I did bring both.”

Lewis gasped. “I love him already.”

The boat eased away from the dock, engine humming. Amelia’s grip on the bench tightened.

“…Oh no.”

Ashley slid over beside her. “You wanna sit closer to the middle? Less sway.”

“Yes. Please. Immediately.”

They rearranged with practiced ease, the Hunters shifting around Amelia like it was second nature. Primal watched, impressed, then offered his arm without thinking. Amelia took it gratefully, eyes shut.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

Fishing lines were cast. Coolers opened. The rhythm of the boat settled into something almost gentle.

Almost.

Amelia lasted maybe fifteen minutes before the world tilted one degree too far.

“I’m going to go… be horizontal,” she announced, carefully lowering herself to the deck. “If I perish, avenge me.”

Eric chuckled. “She’ll be alright.”

Ashley tilted her head. “Or she’ll end up in the water.”

On cue, the boat rocked slightly as Amelia attempted to adjust—

—and promptly slid over the side with a small, offended yelp.

There was a splash.

Then silence.

John stood. “Well, I’ll be—”

A moment later, Amelia resurfaced, floating serenely on her back, tail just beneath the surface, hair slicked back. She inhaled deeply, chest rising, buoyancy settling in.

“…Okay,” she said calmly. “This is better.”

Ashley burst out laughing. “You *did* say you liked swimmin’.”

Primal leaned over the railing, concern softening into relief. “Are you alright?”

Amelia nodded. “Yes. I’m… actually fine. Please don’t pull me back in yet.”

Jeannie smiled warmly. “Let her float. Water’s holdin’ her just fine.”

Lewis dangled his feet in the water nearby. “You look like one of those fancy pool noodles.”

Amelia squinted at him. “I will remember that.”

Primal watched her float, fascination clear. “You look peaceful.”

She closed her eyes, letting the sun warm her face. “…I am.”

Fishing continued. Laughter drifted across the water. The boat rocked gently, but Amelia stayed where she was happiest — half in the lake, half with family, safe and supported.

Primal sat back, relaxing fully for the first time since boarding. He listened to the Hunters talk over each other, tease, share stories. He felt something unfamiliar settle into place.

Belonging.

Ashley caught his eye and smiled.

He smiled back.

And Amelia floated, content, letting the current do the work for once.
