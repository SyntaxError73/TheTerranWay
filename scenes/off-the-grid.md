### **Off the Grid**

Ashley called it *camping*.

Amelia had learned, by the second mile past the last dirt road, that this was a lie.

There was no campground.
No sign.
No fire ring.
No *restroom*.

There wasn’t even a trail anymore — just forest, stretching out in every direction like it had never heard of people and didn’t care to learn.

Ashley stopped at a small clearing and spread her arms wide. “There we go,” she announced proudly. “Perfect spot.”

Amelia stared.

“…Ashley,” she said carefully, “there is *nothing* here.”

Ashley grinned. “Exactly!”

Primal, on the other hand, looked genuinely pleased. His shoulders relaxed the moment they stopped moving, tail uncurling as if the woods themselves had exhaled with him.

“It’s quiet,” he said softly. “I like that.”

Amelia did not respond. She was too busy checking her phone.

No signal.

She checked again. Then her battery percentage.

“…I’m going to die here,” she muttered.

Ashley laughed, already setting up camp with efficient ease. “You brought your charger, right?”

“Yes,” Amelia snapped. “Because I assumed electricity would *exist*.”

Ashley paused, then winced. “Ah.”

Primal tilted his head. “What is a charger?”

Amelia slowly looked at him. “…You know what? Never mind.”

By nightfall, the fire was going, Primal was contentedly tending it, and Ashley was in her element — relaxed, muddy, and happy in a way that only came from being miles away from everyone.

Amelia was inside her tent.

She had been inside her tent for hours.

Wrapped in a blanket.
Tail tucked.
Phone clutched uselessly in her hands like a talisman.

Ashley poked her head inside. “C’mon, Ames. Stars are incredible tonight.”

Amelia didn’t move.

Ashley squinted. “Amelia?”

Nothing.

“…You’re doing the thing, aren’t you?”

Amelia was completely motionless. On her back. Tongue slightly out. Eyes half-lidded.

Playing dead.

Ashley sighed. “You know that only works on predators.”

Primal crouched beside the tent opening, observing with curiosity. “Is she… unwell?”

“No,” Ashley said. “She’s protesting.”

Amelia did not blink.

Ashley leaned closer. “Amelia, if you don’t come sit by the fire, I’m gonna start telling embarrassing stories about you.”

A twitch of Amelia’s tail.

Primal brightened. “Oh, I would like to hear those.”

Amelia sprang upright instantly. “Absolutely not.”

Ashley laughed triumphantly. “There she is.”

Grumbling the entire way, Amelia eventually slithered out and sat near the fire — far enough away to feel safe, close enough to benefit from the warmth. She hugged her knees, staring into the flames with an expression that suggested she was enduring something heroic.

Primal handed her a mug of something warm — herbal, improvised, surprisingly good.

“…Thank you,” she said, quiet but sincere.

Later, when the fire burned low and the forest hummed with night sounds, Ashley leaned back against a log, content. Primal lay nearby, gazing up through the trees. Amelia sat bundled in her blanket, still clearly unhappy — but awake.

“I don’t understand how you like this,” Amelia said finally.

Ashley smiled. “Makes me feel small. In a good way.”

Primal nodded. “And honest.”

Amelia watched the fire crackle, sparks drifting up into the dark. Her phone was dead. There was no signal. No charger. No escape.

…But there was warmth. And quiet. And people who didn’t expect anything from her.

“…I still hate it,” she said.

Ashley grinned. “Wouldn’t be you if you didn’t.”

And when Amelia eventually curled up to sleep — tent zipper half-open, firelight flickering — she didn’t play dead again.

She just slept.

Miles from everything.

Safe anyway.
