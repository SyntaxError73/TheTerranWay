### **Jeannie’s Latest Phase**

Jeannie didn’t *dabble* in crafts.

She committed.

The kitchen table would disappear under supplies — jars, spools, tools she’d researched thoroughly and purchased with intention. Whatever the project was, she approached it like it mattered. Like it deserved her full attention.

This month, it was baking.

Not the usual kind — no, this was *specific*. New techniques. New tools. Recipes printed and annotated. Eric stood beside her, sleeves rolled up, methodical and patient, happy to be her extra set of hands.

“You sure you wanna try this one?” he asked, eyeing the recipe.

Jeannie smiled. “Absolutely.”

They worked in companionable silence, measuring carefully, tasting often. When something went wrong, Jeannie laughed it off and tried again. When something went right, she beamed like she’d cracked a secret code.

Eric loved these days.

He didn’t mind when the project changed.

Because he knew it would.

Two weeks later, the baking supplies were neatly packed away.

Now the table was covered in something else — yarn, maybe. Or paints. Or tools for a craft Jeannie had never attempted before but had become *fascinated* with overnight.

She watched a few videos. Read a few articles. Bought everything she needed to do it “properly.”

Eric passed by, amused. “New thing?”

“Just for now,” Jeannie said cheerfully.

She dove in with the same intensity — hours lost, hands busy, mind alight. And for a little while, it was everything.

Until it wasn’t.

When the interest faded, she didn’t mourn it. She didn’t feel guilty. She just cleaned up, set it aside, and started noticing something new that looked fun.

Jeannie wasn’t chasing mastery.

She was chasing *joy*.

And Eric, steady as ever, understood that.

Whenever she invited him in — to stir, to hold, to test, to help — he showed up.

Because it wasn’t about finishing projects.

It was about sharing them while they lasted.

And Jeannie was always happiest in that moment of curiosity, right before boredom set in.

Which meant there was always something new just around the corner.
