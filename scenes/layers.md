### **Layers**

Amelia always needed coffee when she worked.

It wakes her up — She needed the energy and motivation. Steam curled up from the mug beside her laptop, carrying the faint bitterness she associated with focus and familiarity. The room was quiet except for the soft scratch of her stylus against the tablet.

On the screen, color bloomed slowly.

At first glance, it wasn’t *anything* in particular. A landscape that didn’t quite obey gravity. Shapes that suggested trees but didn’t commit to bark or leaf. A sky fractured into layered hues — not quite Terra, not quite Earth. Somewhere between memory and invention.

Ashley leaned in the doorway, arms crossed, watching.

She smiled.

Primal stood a little farther back, careful not to crowd. He watched Amelia’s hand move more than the screen itself — the certainty of her strokes, the way she paused and adjusted, the small frown of concentration she wore when something didn’t feel right.

“What is it?” he asked quietly.

Amelia didn’t look up. “A piece.”

Ashley snorted softly. “She means a *feelings piece*.”

Amelia shot her a look. “It’s *abstract*.”

“Mmhmm.”

Primal tilted his head, studying the shapes again. “I see… three forms,” he said slowly. “Not separate. Overlapping.”

Amelia hesitated, then nodded. “Yes.”

“They’re not… defined,” he continued, choosing his words carefully. “But they’re close. Sharing space.”

She glanced up at him then, surprised.

Ashley grinned wider.

Primal pointed gently at the center of the image, where light pooled subtly, warmer than the surrounding tones. “That part feels… safe. Like shelter.”

Amelia’s ears warmed. She turned back to the screen, adjusting a gradient. “It’s not literal.”

“I know,” he said immediately. “It doesn’t have to be.”

Ashley finally pushed off the doorframe and came closer, peering over Amelia’s shoulder. “You even hid my tail,” she teased. “Rude.”

“It’s implied,” Amelia muttered.

Primal watched as Amelia added fine details — faint patterns in the light, echoes of scales in the texture of stone, feather-like strokes woven into the shadows. None of it obvious. All of it intentional.

“It’s us,” Ashley said lightly, as if stating the weather.

Amelia didn’t deny it.

Primal blinked. Then looked again, slower this time. His breathing steadied as understanding settled in.

“…You turned us into something else,” he said.

“So it doesn’t feel exposed,” Amelia replied. “I don’t like being obvious.”

He nodded. “It feels… kinder. Like you’re letting the idea exist without forcing it to explain itself.”

She paused, stylus hovering.

“…Yes,” she said softly.

They stood there together for a moment — Amelia drawing, Ashley leaning comfortably close, Primal watching without trying to take anything from the moment.

Finally, Amelia saved the file and leaned back, wrapping both hands around her coffee mug. “It’s not finished.”

Ashley smiled. “The best ones never are.”

Primal looked at the screen one last time, then at Amelia. “Thank you,” he said.

“For what?”

“For seeing us,” he replied simply. “And choosing how to show it.”

Amelia ducked her head, hiding behind the mug as she took a sip. “…You’re welcome.”

Outside, the world went on — loud, unstructured, imperfect.

Inside, three lives overlapped quietly, held together not by labels or certainty, but by shared space, patience, and the gentle art of not saying everything out loud.
