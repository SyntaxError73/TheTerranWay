### **Remote Control**

The argument didn’t start loudly.

It started with the remote.

Ashley had it first — feet up on the coffee table, tail relaxed behind her, a nature survival show already halfway through an episode. On screen, a man whispered intensely at a camera while crouched in mud.

“Now if you look closely,” he murmured, “this footprint tells us—”

A commercial cut in.

A man in mirrored sunglasses stared straight into the camera.

“These aren’t just sunglasses,” he said gravely. “They’re *tactical*.”

Ashley nodded along. “Mmhmm.”

Amelia slithered into the living room, coffee in hand, already tired. She paused when she saw the screen.

“…Are those sunglasses waterproof *and* bulletproof?”

“Probably,” Ashley said cheerfully. “You never know when you’ll need ‘em.”

Amelia sighed and gestured at the TV. “I was going to watch the baking show. The one with the croissants.”

“The one where they cry over pastry?” Ashley asked.

“They *care*,” Amelia corrected. “It’s different.”

Ashley muted the commercial and glanced over. “You can watch it after this episode.”

“That’s what you said last time,” Amelia replied. “And then there was a knife commercial. And then a different knife commercial. And then the sunglasses man came back.”

On screen, the sunglasses man returned, this time hanging upside down from a rope.

Primal, passing through the room, paused. “Why is he… inverted?”

“Tactical,” Ashley said.

Amelia rubbed her temples. “Ashley. Please. I need something low-stress. With timers. And butter.”

Ashley considered this, eyes flicking between Amelia and the TV. The survivalist had returned, now enthusiastically explaining edible moss.

“…Tell you what,” Ashley said finally. “We compromise.”

Amelia narrowed her eyes. “I don’t like the sound of that.”

Ashley grinned. “We watch your baking show *now*—”

Amelia perked up.

“—and during the commercials,” Ashley continued, “I mute it and tell you exactly what kind of tactical gear would be useful in a kitchen emergency.”

Amelia stared at her.

“…No.”

Primal, still standing nearby, tilted his head. “What if we watched both?”

Ashley and Amelia spoke at the same time.

“No.”

Primal paused. “Sequentially?”

Ashley laughed. “She’ll fall asleep.”

“I will *not*,” Amelia said defensively, already curling slightly into the couch.

Ashley softened. “Alright. Baking show first.”

Amelia relaxed immediately, relief visible in the way her shoulders dropped. She flicked the channel over just as the opening theme began — bright music, pastel visuals, cheerful judges.

Ashley leaned back with a dramatic sigh. “I’m only here for moral support.”

Ten minutes later, Ashley was unexpectedly invested.

“Oh that cake’s not gonna set,” she muttered.

Amelia smirked into her coffee. “You said you didn’t care.”

“I don’t,” Ashley replied. “But if she opens the oven *one more time*…”

Primal watched them both from the doorway, amused.

Sometimes compromise didn’t mean giving something up.

Sometimes it just meant sitting together long enough to care about each other’s nonsense.

And when the baking show ended, Ashley reached for the remote.

“Alright,” she said. “Now it’s my turn.”

Amelia sighed — but didn’t protest.

That, too, was compromise.
