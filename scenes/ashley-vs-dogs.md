### **The Ones She Doesn’t Trust**

Ashley never liked dogs.

Coyotes even less.

It wasn’t hatred. It wasn’t ignorance. It was *understanding*.

She knew what they were capable of — not as pets, not as companions, but as animals that hunted cooperatively, relentlessly, and without hesitation when the balance tipped in their favor.

One or two?

She could handle that.

A whole pack?

That was different.

No matter how strong you were, no matter how prepared — numbers changed everything. Packs didn’t fight fair. They tested. They circled. They waited for exhaustion.

Ashley respected that enough to fear it.

So when she heard them near the edge of the property — distant yips, low and probing — her body reacted before her thoughts did.

She straightened.

Her feathers puffed, doubling her apparent size. Her tail lifted high behind her, rigid and alert. She planted her feet wide, grounding herself like she’d been taught as a kid.

“HEY.”

Her voice rang out sharp and commanding, not panicked — *territorial*.

She raised her arms, spreading herself bigger, louder, unmistakably not prey.

“This ain’t for you,” she shouted. “MOVE.”

The noise stopped.

A moment passed.

Then retreat — rustling, movement pulling away from the fence line.

Ashley didn’t chase.

She never chased.

She waited until the woods were quiet again, heart pounding but steady, eyes scanning until she was sure they were gone.

---

Stray dogs were worse.

Unpredictable. Half-tame. Not afraid enough of people to keep distance.

She hated that.

If one wandered too close, she did the same thing every time — yelling, clapping, making herself *impossible to ignore*.

“Git. Go on. OUT.”

She didn’t want them hurt.

She just wanted them *gone*.

Later, when Eric asked if she was alright, she nodded.

“Yeah,” she said. “Handled it.”

Lewis frowned. “You hate dogs more than anything.”

Ashley shook her head. “No. I hate what happens when folks forget what they are.”

She glanced back toward the tree line.

“Some animals don’t give warnings,” she added quietly. “I do.”

And that was the difference.

Ashley didn’t fear coyotes because she was weak.

She feared them because she knew exactly how strong they were — and chose caution over pride every single time.
