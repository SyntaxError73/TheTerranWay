### **The Diagram**

Amelia stopped being surprised by the questions sometime in her early twenties.

They always started the same way — a polite pause, a tilt of the head, someone clearly doing mental geometry where none was required.

“So… where is your—”

Amelia sighed, already reaching into her bag.

“That’s not where that part is,” she said gently. “It’s where it would be on a snake.”

She laid the paper on the table.

It was a neat, carefully labeled diagram she’d drawn herself — her upper torso sketched simply, her lower body tapering smoothly into coils. Clean arrows. Calm handwriting. No drama.

One digestive tract.
One heart.
One set of lungs — one larger, one vestigial.
Everything clustered sensibly around her center of mass.

“Like a normal person,” she continued, tapping the page, “just… longer.”

The human frowned.

“But wouldn’t that mean—”

“No,” Amelia said kindly. “It wouldn’t.”

She rotated the paper slightly, showing the lower annotations.

“Endpoints,” she explained. “Those are where you’d expect them to be on a snake. Everything else stays centralized. There’s no duplication. No mystery.”

The human stared.

“…Huh.”

They stared longer.

“But that doesn’t make sense.”

Amelia closed her eyes for half a second.

“It does,” she said patiently. “It just doesn’t match the version you invented in your head.”

Lewis, hovering nearby, muttered, “You should charge for consultations.”

Ashley snorted. “Or start a class.”

Amelia gathered the diagram back up, smoothing it carefully. She’d redrawn it enough times to know exactly where the folds went.

“For some reason,” she said, not unkindly, “people assume non-human anatomy must be complicated.”

She slid the paper back into her bag.

“It isn’t,” she added. “It’s just… different.”

Later, alone, Amelia sometimes wondered why the idea of *one body, one system* confused people so much when it wasn’t human-shaped.

Then she shrugged it off.

She knew her body.
She lived in it every day.

And if explaining it required a diagram?

Well.

At least she was prepared.
