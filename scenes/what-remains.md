### **What Remains**

The shed lay folded neatly in the basket Ashley had brought in from outside.

Amelia felt… better.

Not euphoric — just *even*. The tightness was gone. The irritability had receded like a bad dream you wake from with relief. Her scales, fresh beneath the old layer, caught the light again, soft and clean, their familiar sheen restored.

She flexed her tail once, experimentally. No itch. No edge.

Normal.

Primal hovered nearby, pretending very badly not to stare at the basket.

Amelia noticed, of course.

“You can look,” she said, mild now, a faint smile tugging at her mouth. “It’s not going to bite you.”

He blinked, then stepped closer. Carefully. Always carefully. He crouched beside the basket and studied the shed skin with an expression that wasn’t revulsion or fascination — but something closer to reverence.

“You’re… brighter,” he said. “After.”

“That’s how it works,” Amelia replied. “Old layer comes off. New one’s already there.”

He nodded slowly, then hesitated. His tailtip flicked once — a tell she was beginning to recognize.

“May I ask something?” he said.

She glanced at him. “That depends entirely on what you’re about to ask.”

He swallowed. “I was wondering if I could… keep it. A small piece.”

She stared at him.

Not in anger. Not even in surprise — just processing.

“…Why?” she asked.

He didn’t rush to answer. That mattered.

“In my culture,” he said quietly, “things that are shed willingly are… meaningful. Proof of survival. Of continuity. I don’t mean it as ownership. Or… anything like that.”

Amelia’s brow furrowed slightly. “You want… my old skin. As a keepsake.”

“Yes,” he admitted. Then added, quickly, “If that’s strange or uncomfortable, please say so. I won’t be offended.”

She leaned back against the couch, considering.

On Terra, shed was mundane. Something you cleaned up, disposed of, forgot. It was private, but not sacred. Still, something about the way he asked — tentative, respectful — made it feel different.

“…You know it’s literally trash, right?” she said dryly.

He smiled, just a little. “Most meaningful things are.”

She snorted despite herself.

After a moment, she reached into the basket and carefully separated a small, intact section — thin, translucent, almost fragile now that it was no longer part of her. She held it out to him.

“One piece,” she said. “And if you ever make it weird, I’m never letting you live it down.”

His eyes widened slightly as he accepted it, hands gentle as if he were holding something that might vanish if mishandled.

“I won’t,” he promised. “I just… wanted something to remember that you trusted me. Even when you didn’t feel like yourself.”

Her ears warmed.

“…You’re very strange,” she said.

“I know.”

She watched as he carefully wrapped the piece in cloth and tucked it away, satisfied but not possessive. When he looked back at her, his expression was soft — not triumphant, not expectant.

Just grateful.

Amelia exhaled, a quiet sound.

“Well,” she said, stretching. “If you’re done bonding with my discarded epidermis… I could really go for tea.”

He brightened immediately. “I’ll put the kettle on.”

As he moved away, Amelia glanced once more at the basket — at what she’d left behind.

And for the first time, she didn’t think of it as something to hide or forget.

Just something that marked the passing of time.

And the people who stayed.
