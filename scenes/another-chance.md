### **Another Chance**

Lewis didn’t tell anyone about the date at first.

Not because he was ashamed—just because saying it out loud felt like tempting fate. He went through the motions quietly: shower, clean shirt, overthinking his hair, then giving up and letting it do whatever it was going to do anyway.

When he came back that night, he looked… thoughtful.

Not giddy. Not crushed. Just processing.

Ashley clocked it immediately. She didn’t pounce. She waited.

It came out later, when they were both leaning against the kitchen counter, picking at leftovers.

“…So,” Lewis said casually, “I went on a date.”

Ashley froze mid-bite. “…You *what*?”

He winced. “See, this is why I didn’t say anything.”

She grinned wide. “You went on a DATE.”

“Yeah.”

“With a human.”

“Yeah.”

“And she knew you’re half raptor.”

“She did,” he said. “Actually, that part was fine.”

Ashley blinked. “Huh.”

Lewis nodded. “She was cool about it. Asked questions. Normal ones. Anatomy-adjacent ones.”

Ashley narrowed her eyes. “Oh no.”

“It came up,” he said defensively. “Eventually.”

There was a beat.

“…Did you have to explain,” Ashley asked carefully, “*the situation*?”

Lewis sighed. “Yes.”

“And?”

He mimed the conversation with his hands, voice shifting into polite-explanatory mode.

“She goes, ‘So… is it like… external?’”

Ashley snorted.

“And I go, ‘Nope.’” He paused, then added, deadpan, “She goes, ‘So it’s on the inside?’”

Ashley lost it. “NO.”

Lewis nodded solemnly. “‘Yup,’” he continued. “‘For now.’”

Ashley laughed so hard she had to grab the counter. “You didn’t.”

“I absolutely did.”

“…How’d she take that?”

Lewis shrugged. “Honestly? Better than expected. Asked a follow-up. Very respectful. We changed the subject shortly after.”

Ashley wiped her eyes. “I cannot believe that was not the dealbreaker.”

“It wasn’t,” he said. “Which is… new.”

She sobered a little. “So why’d it end?”

Lewis thought about it.

Not long. Just honestly.

“…I think I’m just,” he gestured vaguely, “too passive.”

Ashley tilted her head.

“I don’t push,” he continued. “I don’t escalate. I don’t make big moves. I’m very ‘we can do whatever you want’ and apparently that reads as ‘not that into it.’”

Ashley frowned. “But you *were* into it.”

“I know,” Lewis said. “But enthusiasm in my head doesn’t always make it out.”

They stood there quietly for a moment.

“…Still,” Ashley said, nudging him with her elbow, “I’m proud of you.”

He smiled a little. “Yeah?”

“You put yourself out there. Explained weird biology. Survived.”

“That *is* kind of a milestone.”

“And hey,” she added gently, “it not landing don’t mean you messed it up.”

Lewis nodded. “I know. Just… data.”

Ashley grinned. “Look at you. Turnin’ feelings into a spreadsheet.”

“Emotional analytics,” he corrected.

Later that night, Lewis lay in bed, staring at the ceiling—not spiraling, not panicking. Just letting the experience settle.

The date hadn’t worked out.

But it hadn’t gone badly either.

And for the first time, that felt like progress.

Sometimes it wasn’t about finding the right person.

Sometimes it was just learning that you could explain who you are—awkward details and all—and still walk away intact.

That was something Lewis could build on.

Even if he took his time doing it.
