### **Closure Required**

There’s one thing that will flip Ashley from calm to incandescent faster than almost anything else.

It’s not secrets.
It’s not being told *no*.
It’s not even bad news.

It’s this:

“Hey, I was gonna tell you something—
…nevermind.”

Ashley freezes.

Not because she *needs* to know.
She genuinely doesn’t care what the thing was.

It’s the **lack of closure**.

Her brain latches onto the open loop like a hook under the skin.

“…No,” she says carefully. “You can’t do that.”

The other person will laugh it off. “It’s nothing.”

That’s when her jaw tightens.

“If it’s nothin’,” she says, voice already edging sharp, “then you can say it.”

They shrug. “I’d rather not.”

Ashley feels the heat hit her chest.

It’s not curiosity.
It’s not paranoia.

It’s the implication.

You started a sentence.
You invited her attention.
And then you yanked it away.

To Ashley, that reads as:
*I don’t trust you with closure.*

She tries to explain—she really does.

“I ain’t offended by content,” she says, hands moving, trying to stay regulated. “You could tell me a *fake* answer and I’d be fine. I just need the loop closed.”

Sometimes people don’t listen.

“I said nevermind,” they insist.

That’s when it happens.

Ashley throws her hands up, turns away, and lets it fly—not at anyone, just into the air.

“FOR THE LOVE OF—JUST FINISH A THOUGHT!”
“SON OF A—!”
“WHY WOULD YOU *START* A SENTENCE—!”

It’s not pretty.

It’s not graceful.

But it’s honest.

She paces. Feathers bristling. Tail lashing. Cursing the *concept* of unfinished communication like it personally wronged her.

Lewis understands immediately.
Eric steps in to de-escalate.
John mutters, “Just tell her *something*, man.”

Because the truth is simple:

Ashley doesn’t need access to everything.
She just needs to not be left hanging.

If someone can say “nevermind,” they can say:

* “It was dumb.”
* “I forgot.”
* “It doesn’t matter.”
* “I changed my mind.”

Any of those would work.

What doesn’t work is silence dressed up as dismissal.

Because to Ashley, that isn’t about the information—

it’s about respect.

And she will not pretend otherwise.
