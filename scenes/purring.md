### **Purring**

Ashley doesn’t always realize she’s doing it.

It usually happens when she’s stretched out somewhere warm and safe—boots kicked off, feathers loose, tail relaxed. The sound starts low in her chest, a soft vibration that deepens into something halfway between a cat’s purr and a pigeon’s gentle coo.

It’s quiet. Unconscious.

Primal notices before anyone else.

He’ll pause mid-motion, tail giving a slow, happy swish behind him. “You’re doing it,” he’ll say softly.

Ashley blinks. “Doin’ what?”

“That,” he replies, smiling.

She goes still for half a second—then laughs when she realizes. “Well I’ll be. Guess I’m comfy.”

Amelia hears it too, eventually. At first she thinks it’s something mechanical—an appliance humming, maybe. When she realizes it’s *Ashley*, she freezes.

“…Are you purring?” she asks.

Ashley grins, unapologetic. “Yep.”

Amelia doesn’t comment further. But later, when Ashley’s stressed and *not* purring, Amelia notices that too.

Primal’s purr is different.

Lower. Rougher. It doesn’t resonate in his chest so much as through his whole body, a faint rumble that vibrates along his ribs and down his tail. It only comes out when he’s truly at ease—when he forgets to monitor himself.

His tail gives him away first.

A slow wag. Then another.

Ashley catches it once and teases him mercilessly. “You wag when you’re happy.”

He flushes instantly. “I do not.”

She points. “Buddy, your tail’s tellin’ on you.”

Amelia watches this exchange quietly, sipping her coffee.

Later—much later—she’ll notice something else.

When the house is quiet, and Ashley is purring softly, Primal’s tail sways without him noticing. And when Primal rumbles low and content, Ashley’s feathers fluff just a little.

Different sounds.

Same feeling.

Comfort.
