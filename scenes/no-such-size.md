### **No Such Size**

It started with a broken sole.

Eric noticed it halfway through the morning, the familiar *flap* with every step finally impossible to ignore. He paused on the porch, lifted one foot, and stared down at the offending boot like it had personally betrayed him.

“…Well that ain’t good.”

Ashley leaned against the railing, lacing her own boots. “What’d you do, wrestle a tractor again?”

“Wasn’t wrestlin’,” Eric said defensively. “It slipped.”

Lewis peered over. “That boot’s older than me.”

“Rude,” Eric muttered.

By noon, they were in town.

And by town, Eric had learned something very important:

Earth did not make shoes for digitigrade raptor legs.

They tried the outdoor store first.

The clerk stared. Blinked. Stared again.

“So… you’re gonna want something with an ankle,” he said slowly.

Eric lifted his leg slightly. “I do not *have* an ankle.”

“…Right.”

They tried work boots. Hiking boots. Custom orthotics. A place that proudly advertised *We Fit Anyone*.

They did not fit Eric.

Ashley perched on a bench, watching Eric attempt to wedge his claw into something that was very clearly not meant for him. “I told y’all,” she said cheerfully. “Earth folks ain’t built for us.”

Lewis wandered off and came back holding a pair of neon sneakers. “What about these?”

Eric glared. “I will throw you into the sun.”

Primal stood nearby, quiet but attentive, tail curled close. He watched Eric’s frustration build, the way his shoulders stiffened as each option failed.

“Well that sure is something,” Primal said gently.

Eric exhaled hard. “I just need somethin’ that won’t fall apart.”

Jeannie, who had been patiently observing the entire time, finally spoke. “You don’t need a shoe,” she said calmly. “You need protection.”

Everyone turned to look at her.

She continued, unbothered. “On Terra, you didn’t wear shoes because you could buy ‘em anywhere. You wore what worked.”

Ashley’s eyes lit up. “Oh.”

Lewis snapped his fingers. “Oh.”

Eric frowned. “…Oh.”

That evening, they spread supplies out on the table at home.

Leather scraps. Heavy canvas. Reinforced rubber. Straps and buckles salvaged from old gear. Ashley held things in place while Eric tested weight and balance. Lewis sketched adjustments. Primal fetched tools quietly and offered steady hands when needed.

It wasn’t pretty.

But when Eric stood up and took a few careful steps, the new footwear held.

He stomped once. Twice.

“…Huh,” he said. “That’ll do.”

Ashley grinned. “Custom job. One of a kind.”

Lewis nodded solemnly. “We could start a business.”

Eric looked down at his feet, then at his family. The irritation had faded, replaced with something warmer.

“Yeah,” he said. “That sure is somethin’.”

Later, as they cleaned up, Primal glanced at Amelia. “Do you need shoes?”

She blinked. “…I do not.”

He nodded, relieved. “Yeah.”

And just like that, Earth adjusted—not by manufacturing something new, but by letting a family build what they needed with their own hands.
