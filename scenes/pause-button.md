### **Pause Button**


Ashley really thought she’d outsmarted herself this time.

Demolition derby game. Single-player. CPU opponents. No real people to beat, no leaderboard to shame her.

“Okay,” she’d said confidently, controller in hand. “This’ll be fine.”

It was not fine.

The level wasn’t even *unfair*. That was the worst part. It was just hard enough to punish her mistakes and just forgiving enough to make her think *this next run is the one*.

Crash.
Restart.

Too aggressive.
Restart.

Played it safe.
Still lost.

Her jaw tightened. Her accent thickened. The room filled with a steady stream of muttered curses that weren’t aimed at anyone—just vented into the universe.

“Come on—no, no, NO—are you *kiddin’ me*—”

Time got weird.

She wasn’t tracking minutes anymore. Just attempts.

Then John’s voice drifted in from down the hall.

“Dinner’s ready!”

Ashley didn’t look away from the screen. “In a minute!”

She meant it.

She *knew* dinner was ready. She could smell it. She wasn’t ignoring him. Her brain just couldn’t let go yet—not without finishing this.

Another run.

Another near-miss.

Her shoulders crept up around her ears. She swore again, louder this time, immediately followed by guilt.

“I know, I know,” she muttered to no one. “I’m comin’. Just—just gotta beat this.”

More than a minute passed.

She felt it. The pressure of it. The ticking awareness that she was supposed to stop *now*. That she was crossing from “allowed transition time” into “this is getting tense.”

That awareness didn’t help.

It made it worse.

Because now she was frustrated at the game *and* herself.

Her hands shook a little. She wiped them on her pants, took a breath, tried again.

Lost.

“SON OF A—!” She cut herself off, exhaling hard. “Dang it. Dang it.”

She hovered over the pause button. Didn’t press it.

Her brain refused the idea of walking away unfinished. If she went to dinner like this, the level would sit in the back of her mind, buzzing, pulling at her attention the entire meal. No reset. No closure.

She hated that about herself.

She hated knowing better and still feeling stuck.

John didn’t yell. Didn’t scold. He just came closer this time, leaning against the doorframe.

“Hey,” he said gently. “You stuck?”

Ashley swallowed, eyes still on the screen. “Yeah.”

That one word carried everything: the frustration, the conflict, the wanting to do the right thing and not being able to yet.

John nodded. “Alright. How ‘bout this—pause it. Dinner’ll wait five more minutes. Then we reset.”

She hesitated.

Then, finally, she hit pause.

The silence felt loud.

Her shoulders dropped all at once, like she’d been holding them up with effort she hadn’t realized was there.

“…Okay,” she said quietly.

John squeezed her shoulder once. “Good job stoppin’.”

She didn’t argue. She just set the controller down carefully, like it might bite her if she moved too fast.

Dinner tasted better once the buzzing stopped.

The level could wait.

But Ashley made a mental note, annoyed and accepting at the same time:

Single-player didn’t mean *low stakes*.

Her brain didn’t care who she was competing against.

It just cared about **finishing**.

And sometimes, knowing that was the hardest part of the fight.
