### **Just a Little Garden**

They never called it a farm.

Not out loud.

It started with Jeannie pointing at a patch of ground beside the house and saying, “That spot gets good sun.”

Ashley squinted at it. “So does the driveway.”

“Yes, but the driveway doesn’t *want* to grow things,” Jeannie replied calmly.

That settled it.

Eric broke the ground first — slow, methodical, making sure not to rush the soil like it owed him something. He treated it gently, like he remembered what land could do when you listened to it.

John stood nearby with his hands on his hips, offering commentary.

“This dirt’s different,” he said. “Still dirt, but it ain’t home dirt.”

Ashley nodded. “Yeah. But it’s tryin’.”

Lewis labeled everything.

Too many things, really. Stakes with handwritten names. Notes about sun cycles. Speculation about what *might* thrive here if given the chance.

“This one’s experimental,” he’d say.

Ashley grinned. “They’re all experimental, Newt.”

They planted what made sense.

Not acres. Not rows meant for selling.

Just enough.

Greens that Ashley tolerated *slightly* better when she’d grown them herself. Root vegetables that felt forgiving. Herbs Jeannie wanted to try drying. Flowers John insisted on “for morale.”

Amelia helped from the edges — sketching layouts, holding tools, watering carefully. She liked watching things grow. Liked knowing exactly where everything was.

Primal built a small border for the garden, quiet and sturdy, making sure nothing wandered in that shouldn’t. He stood there often, arms crossed, simply existing nearby.

---

Nothing was perfect.

Some plants struggled. Others surprised them. A few things grew wildly out of proportion, like they’d found a loophole.

Ashley crouched in the dirt one afternoon, hands muddy, smiling to herself.

“It’s not the farm,” she said.

Eric wiped his hands on a rag. “No.”

“But it’s enough,” she added.

Jeannie looked around — at the soil, the leaves, the people — and nodded.

“It’s a start.”

They didn’t measure success in yield.

They measured it in mornings spent checking on things.
In dirt under their claws.
In the quiet satisfaction of watching life take hold again.

It wasn’t Terra.

But it was theirs.

And sometimes, a happy little garden was all you really needed to feel rooted again.
