### **The Voice**

Ashley only found it because she was bored.

Rainy afternoon. Everyone else busy. She had her headphones on, scrolling through music—ambient stuff, survivalist playlists, things with drums that made her tail twitch.

She tapped one link at random.

A low drone filled her ears. Then a guitar. Then strings. Then a voice—clear, layered, echoing like it was coming from somewhere vast and hollow.

She froze.

“…That’s… nice,” she murmured.

The voice rose—strong, aching, familiar in a way that made her chest tighten.

Her breath caught.

“…Wait.”

She pulled the headphones off one ear, like that might help.

“…Ain’t that *me*?”

Her heart started pounding as she scrubbed back through the track. The voice was unmistakable now. The way it leaned into certain notes. The breath between phrases. The *purr* under the sound when it got soft.

Her voice.

Her stomach dropped.

“Oh you have GOT to be kidding me.”

Ashley shot upright, feathers bristling. A thousand thoughts collided at once—panic, anger, exposure, that deep, old fear of being seen when she hadn’t chosen it.

*Who the hell recorded me.*
*Who put this online.*
*I am going to kick them so hard—*

She stormed down the hall, phone clenched in her hand, tail lashing.

“LEWIS.”

A beat.

“…What?”

She burst into his room without knocking. Lewis—Newt—was at his desk, headphones around his neck, DAW open on his screen like a crime scene.

Ashley shoved the phone in his face. “WHY IS MY VOICE ON THE INTERNET.”

Lewis blinked.

Once.

Then twice.

“…Oh.”

*Oh.*

That one syllable did *not* help his case.

Ashley loomed, hands on her hips. “You recorded me. Without telling me. You uploaded it. I am going to—”

“I didn’t upload *you*,” Lewis blurted, hands flying up. “I uploaded the *music*.”

She stared at him.

“…Explain,” she growled.

He spun his chair toward the screen, already clicking things open, words tumbling out fast. “Okay so—remember when you sing when you think nobody’s home?”

Her glare intensified. “…You mean when I’m ALONE.”

“Yeah! Exactly! So I was working on ambient stuff and I heard you through the vent and I was like—oh my god that’s *perfect*—not in a creepy way—in a *holy crap that sound has texture* way—”

Ashley pinched the bridge of her nose. “Lewis.”

He took a breath. Slowed down. “I recorded it on my phone. I didn’t put your name anywhere. No video. No face. Just… sound.”

He hesitated, then added quietly, “It’s beautiful, Ash.”

That stopped her.

She looked back at the phone. At the waveform. At the comments scrolling beneath the track.

*This voice is unreal.*
*Whoever this singer is—wow.*
*Haunting.*

Her anger wavered, just a little.

“…You shoulda asked,” she said, voice tight.

“I know,” Lewis said immediately. “I messed up. I just—I didn’t think you’d ever let me if I did.”

She huffed. “…You’re probably right.”

They stood there for a moment, the rain tapping against the window, her voice still faintly echoing from the speakers.

“You like it?” he asked carefully.

Ashley swallowed. “…Yeah. I do.”

Lewis smiled, soft and genuine. “I knew you would.”

She glared at him. “I still get to kick you.”

“That’s fair.”

She sighed, shoulders dropping, the fight draining out of her. “…You really think it sounds good?”

Lewis didn’t hesitate. “I think people hear it and feel something. That’s rare.”

Ashley looked away, embarrassed now, tail curling inward. “…Don’t make it a big thing.”

“I won’t,” he promised. “Your rules. Always.”

She nodded, then pointed at him. “Next time you ask.”

“Next time I ask.”

“And you take it down if I say so.”

“Immediately.”

She turned to leave, then paused at the door.

“…Newt?”

“Yeah?”

“…Thanks. For thinkin’ I was worth listenin’ to.”

Lewis grinned. “Always have.”

Ashley walked back down the hall, heart still racing—but lighter now.

She was still going to sing when she thought she was alone.

But maybe—

Just maybe—

She wouldn’t be so scared if someone heard her anymore.
