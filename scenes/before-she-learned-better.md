### **Before She Learned Better**

Ashley wasn’t always kind.

In elementary school, she was loud. Confident. Bigger than most of the other kids and already stronger than she realized. She talked with a thick country accent and learned very quickly that if people were going to look at her like she didn’t belong, she might as well *lean into it*.

So she did.

She teased first. Pushed buttons. Said sharp things with a grin and called it joking. When other kids flinched, she felt powerful — not because she wanted to hurt them, but because it meant *they weren’t hurting her*.

Teachers called her “spirited.”
Kids from the city called her “mean.”

They weren’t wrong.

Ashley learned that being intimidating kept people at a distance. It kept her safe from being laughed at for her clothes, her voice, her background. If she was the bully, she didn’t have to worry about being the target.

But it didn’t feel good.

Not really.

The turning point didn’t come with punishment.

It came with **middle school**.

Suddenly, Ashley wasn’t the biggest anymore. Not the loudest. Not the one in control. The same kids she used to snap at now ignored her completely — or worse, mocked her for being “slow” or “country.”

She didn’t know how to handle that.

That was when she learned what it felt like to be on the other side.

And it stayed with her.

Ashley never talked about it much.

She didn’t brag about who she’d been, and she didn’t try to rewrite it either. She just… changed. Quietly. Intentionally.

She learned how words landed. Learned when to step back. Learned how to protect without attacking.

When she promised Amelia she’d protect her forever, she meant it in a way only someone who had once done harm could.

She knew what *not* to be.

Ashley isn’t proud of who she was as a kid.

But she isn’t ashamed either.

She grew.

And the people who grow the hardest are often the ones who had to unlearn themselves first.

That’s part of why she’s so gentle now.

She knows exactly how much damage careless strength can do.
