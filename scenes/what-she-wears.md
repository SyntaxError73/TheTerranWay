### **What She Wears**

Amelia didn’t dress to be noticed.

She dressed to feel *assembled*.

There was a time — early, formative — when clothes were just clothes. Whatever was clean. Whatever fit. Whatever her parents approved of before heading out the door again.

But as she got older, Amelia realized something important:

The world treated her differently when she looked like she had made a decision.

So she started making them.

---

The **green button-up** came first.

Green felt calm. Safe. Alive without being loud. It reminded her of parks, of leaves pressed flat between book pages, of things that stayed. Button-ups had structure — they stayed where you put them. They didn’t slide or cling or surprise you.

They were predictable.

The **darker green jacket** followed later. A layer between her and everything else. Something she could shrug into when she felt exposed. Something with weight.

Ashley once teased her. “You always look like you’re about to go read a book somewhere important.”

Amelia had smiled. “That’s the idea.”

---

The **beret** was deliberate.

It wasn’t trendy. It wasn’t flashy. It framed her face without demanding attention, and more importantly, it gave her hands something to do when she was nervous — adjusting it, pressing it down, grounding herself.

It made her feel *put together* even on days when she wasn’t.

The **glasses** came next — large, nerdy frames, unmistakable.

She could’ve chosen something subtler. She didn’t.

They told the world, *I see things differently*. They set expectations. People assumed she was quiet, bookish, harmless.

Which suited her just fine.

And they worked. Without them, the world blurred too much — edges soft, danger harder to spot. Amelia needed clarity. Always had.

---

The **pearl earrings** were the only thing she wore for someone else.

Her parents had given them to her young. Not out of sentimentality, but because pearls were “appropriate.” Professional. Timeless.

Amelia kept them anyway.

Not because they reminded her of her parents — but because they reminded her that she could take something given without warmth and *make it hers*.

They were small. Unassuming. Hard-earned, in a way.

The **gold watch** was Ashley’s favorite detail.

“You don’t even need that,” Ashley had said once.

“I know,” Amelia replied. “But I like knowing where time is.”

The watch was solid. Real. It ticked steadily, no matter how her thoughts raced. No matter how nervous she felt.

It told her: *You are still here. Time is moving. You’re okay.*

---

Altogether, Amelia’s fashion did something very important.

It told the world she was thoughtful. Intentional. Not to be rushed.

And it told *herself* something even more vital:

That she was allowed to take up space carefully, beautifully, on her own terms.

Ashley thought Amelia dressed “like a character in a story.”

Amelia liked that.

Characters, after all, were people who mattered.
