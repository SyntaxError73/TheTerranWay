### **Wet Lips**

That contradiction bothers her more than it bothers anyone else.

Ashley can deal with **blood** without blinking.
Sweat? Normal.
Mud, guts, wounds, waste—those are just facts of bodies doing what bodies do. There’s a strange comfort in it, even. It’s honest. It *means something happened*.

Blood especially doesn’t scare her. It’s sharp, metallic, real. It has context.

But **saliva**?

Absolutely not.

It doesn’t matter that it’s sterile.
It doesn’t matter that it’s always in her own mouth.
The moment it’s *outside*—visible, stringy, shiny, *wet*—her entire nervous system lights up like a siren.

Nope.
No thank you.
Hard stop.

She’s tried to reason with herself about it.

> *You literally have this in your mouth right now.*

Doesn’t help.

> *It’s not dangerous.*

Still no.

> *This makes no sense.*

Correct—and irrelevant.

Saliva triggers something deep and immediate, a full-body *wrong* that she can’t talk herself out of. The smell, the texture, the way it moves—it all hits her sensory alarm at once.

That’s why she’s never kissed anyone on the mouth.

Not because she’s shy.
Not because she’s inexperienced.
Not because she doesn’t want closeness.

Wet lips just… **repulse** her.

She’s had moments—almost-kisses—where someone leaned in, breath close, mouths inches apart. Her brain would short-circuit instantly.

*Oh no. That’s gonna be wet.*

And she’d pull back, heart racing, apologizing awkwardly, feeling ridiculous for something she couldn’t control.

Blood on her hands after an accident? Fine.
Spit on someone’s lips? Absolutely not.

It frustrates her. Embarrasses her. Makes her wonder why *this* of all things is the line her body drew.

But over time, she’s learned something important:

Her boundaries don’t have to make sense to be real.

She doesn’t owe anyone an explanation that satisfies *logic*.
She only owes herself safety.

And the people who matter—the ones who actually see her—don’t tease her for it. They don’t push. They don’t try to “fix” her.

They just accept that Ashley is someone who can gut a fish barehanded, tend a bleeding wound without flinching…

…and still recoil at the idea of wet lips touching hers.

Bodies are weird.
Brains are weirder.

And Ashley has stopped apologizing for the way hers keeps her comfortable.
