### **Escalation**

Eric didn’t even look up from tightening a strap.
“I will throw you into the sun.”

Lewis froze.

Slowly… *slowly*… his eyes lit up.

“…Okay but hear me out,” he said, already doomed. “What if the sun wasn’t hot enough to handle me.”

Eric closed his eyes. “Don’t.”

“And,” Lewis continued, pacing now, hands moving, “what if my sheer mass displaced the plasma just enough to cause instability—”

Ashley groaned. “Oh no.”

“—and then the sun *explodes*,” Lewis finished triumphantly. “Because of *me*.”

There was a long silence.

Primal tilted his head. “That would be… very inconvenient.”

Amelia blinked. “You just invented solar homicide.”

Lewis grinned. “Accidental! I was the victim!”

Eric finally looked up, deadpan.
“I will throw you into the *concept* of the sun.”

Lewis gasped. “Metaphysical.”

Jeannie sipped her coffee. “If the sun explodes, dinner’s canceled.”

Lewis snapped his fingers. “See? Stakes!”

Ashley laughed so hard she had to sit down. “You’re banned from physics.”

Lewis bowed. “Worth it.”

Eric shook his head, but there was a smile tugging at his mouth despite himself.
“…Y’all are unbearable.”
