### **Tasked Tunes**

Ashley sings the way some people breathe.

Not *performing*.
Not *projecting*.

Just… letting sound happen.

She’ll be padding through the house, doing something entirely mundane—washing her hands, tying her hair up, refilling a bowl—and out it comes.

🎶 “Maaaarbles is a tiny little menace—
tiny paws, big opinions—” 🎶

Marbles, from the doorway, flicks her tail like she understands she’s being honored.

Sometimes it’s about what Ashley’s doing.

🎶 “Gotta find my shoes—
why are they *never* where I left ‘em—” 🎶

Sometimes it’s not words at all.

Just hums. Soft, wandering melodies that loop back on themselves like she’s testing shapes in the air. She’ll stop mid-note, adjust pitch, hum again—like tuning an instrument that happens to be her own chest.

Lewis once said, “You sound like you’re thinkin’ out loud in music.”

Ashley liked that.

And if you watch closely, you can see where it comes from.

John whistles.

All the time.

Walking through the house. Fixing something. Waiting for the kettle. A constant stream of tuneless-but-confident little melodies that pop in and out without warning.

Jeannie tolerates it… to a point.

“John,” she’ll say gently from the other room, “I love you.”

He pauses. “Yes ma’am?”

“And I am *full*.”

The whistling stops instantly.

Ashley notices this exchange every time and grins, because she knows exactly how that feels—sound being comfort one moment and *too much* the next.

So she does the same.

She sings until someone says, “Hey, Ash?”

And she stops. No hurt feelings. No embarrassment.

Music, to her, isn’t something you turn on or off for attention.

It’s just a way of occupying space gently.

A way of saying, *I’m here, and I’m okay.*

And when she’s really happy—when she’s safe and settled—you can hear it in the way her humming fills the room without ever asking to be noticed.

Just like her dad’s whistling.

Just like home.
