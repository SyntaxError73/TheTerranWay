### **When the Dead Walk**

John was pacing.

That alone was the first sign.

He had a notebook tucked under one arm, coffee in the other hand, beard untrimmed and eyes bright in a way that meant he’d been thinking about this *all night*.

“Now I’m just sayin’,” he announced, stopping dead in the middle of the room, “when it happens, I don’t wanna hear a single one of y’all say you weren’t warned.”

Jeannie didn’t even look up from what she was doing. “Uh-huh.”

Eric leaned back in his chair, hands folded over his stomach. Calm. Patient. “What’s happenin’ this time, Dad?”

“The zombie apocalypse,” John said proudly. “Eventually. It’s inevitable.”

Lewis groaned from the couch, already halfway under a blanket. “If that happens, I’m simply optin’ out.”

John pointed at him. “That right there is how you get eaten first.”

Lewis closed his eyes. “That’s fine.”

Ashley, on the other hand, looked intrigued.

“How we talkin’?” she asked. “Like… fast zombies or slow ones?”

John’s face lit up. “Excellent question.”

Jeannie sighed. “Lord.”

“See, I’m preparin’ for *both*,” John continued. “Slow ones are easy. You just don’t get careless. Fast ones—now that’s where teamwork matters.”

Eric nodded thoughtfully. “Teamwork’s important regardless.”

John beamed. “That’s my boy.”

Eric didn’t believe a word of it. But he also knew when to let his dad have his joy.

For the next few days, John was *on a mission*.

He tried to assign roles.

Eric: logistics, fortification, keeping people calm.
Ashley: scouting, running, “whatever feral nonsense you do.”
Lewis: “brains.”
Lewis refused.

“I am not wakin’ up early to fight zombies,” he said flatly.

“You ain’t wakin’ up at all if you don’t,” John shot back cheerfully.

Ashley had fun with it—*for a bit*.

She helped inventory supplies. Practiced running drills. Even got competitive about who could climb the fence fastest.

By day three, she was bored.

“Dad,” she said gently, “I love you, but if I hear ‘when the dead rise’ one more time, I’m gonna throw myself into the creek.”

John laughed. “That’s fine! Water’s good camouflage.”

She stared at him. “You’re impossible.”

---

Jeannie, meanwhile, continued her life uninterrupted.

She’d heard this speech before.

Y2K.
Solar flares.
Economic collapse.
Aliens.

Zombies were just the latest flavor.

She let John ramble. Let him plan. Let him feel useful and excited and alive.

That was love, too.

One evening, as John was enthusiastically explaining escape routes *again*, Eric placed a hand on his shoulder.

“Dad,” he said gently, “if the zombies do come… we’ll be ready.”

John smiled. “That’s all I ask.”

Lewis yawned. “Wake me when they’re gone.”

Ashley laughed.

Jeannie shook her head fondly.

And John?
John slept better that night than he had in weeks.

Because whether the apocalypse ever came or not, his family was together—and that was all the preparation he really needed.
