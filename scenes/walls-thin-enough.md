### **Walls, Thin Enough**

The house had its own rhythm by now.

Floorboards that creaked in specific places. Pipes that knocked once before settling. The soft, constant hum of something electrical that Amelia never quite identified but had learned to tune out.

And, occasionally—

Ashley.

It started as water.

Then steam.

Then a voice.

It rose suddenly, filling the space in a way Ashley herself never quite seemed to realize she was capable of. Strong, clear, unrestrained. A folk melody at first, then something improvised, words bending and shifting as she went. Notes echoed off tile and plaster, carrying down the hall and into the living room.

Primal froze mid-step.

Amelia paused with her stylus hovering just above her tablet.

They looked at each other.

Neither said a word.

Ashley’s voice climbed higher, confident and full, completely unselfconscious in the privacy she believed she had. It wasn’t polished in the way performances were — it was *alive*. Emotion slipped into the notes without permission, rising and falling like breath.

Primal’s ears warmed slightly. He sat down on the couch, careful, hands folding loosely in his lap. “She sounds… happy,” he said quietly.

Amelia nodded. “She does that in the shower. Always has.”

“She doesn’t sing like that otherwise.”

“No,” Amelia agreed. “That’s the point.”

They listened — not leaning in, not straining — just existing in the same space while the sound passed through it. Amelia turned her volume down a notch so her work didn’t intrude. Primal adjusted the kettle on the stove, making sure it didn’t whistle.

Ashley hit a particularly strong note, laughed at herself mid-song, then kept going like nothing had happened.

Primal smiled without realizing it.

“She’d be embarrassed if she knew we could hear her,” he said.

Amelia snorted softly. “Mortified.”

“Should we tell her?”

Amelia considered that for half a second before shaking her head. “No. She knows, on some level. But she sings because she thinks she’s alone.”

Primal nodded, understanding settling easily. “Then we should let her have that.”

They let the song run its course. They didn’t comment. Didn’t tease. Didn’t mark the moment as something to be acknowledged or shared.

Eventually the water shut off. The voice faded. The house returned to its quieter shape.

A few minutes later, Ashley emerged from the hallway with damp hair and an easy grin, towel slung over her shoulder like nothing extraordinary had happened.

“Hey,” she said. “Anyone want tea?”

Primal smiled. “It’s already on.”

Ashley blinked, pleased. Amelia sipped her coffee, eyes back on her screen.

No one mentioned the singing.

And that, in its own small way, was how they showed they cared.
