### **For a Little While**

Amelia could make herself taller.

Not permanently. Not comfortably.

But *briefly*.

It usually happened without announcement — a stretch through her coils, a careful tightening of muscles, her upper body rising inch by inch as she lifted herself higher than she normally stood.

Ashley noticed it first one afternoon while they were talking in the kitchen.

“…Are you—” Ashley paused, blinking. “Amelia, are you taller?”

Amelia’s chin was lifted slightly. Her shoulders were held with visible effort.

“Yes,” she said calmly. “…For the moment.”

Ashley stared. “Why.”

“I wanted to see the top shelf,” Amelia replied, as if that explained everything.

Her arms trembled faintly.

Lewis looked over from the table. “You’re gonna gas out.”

“I am aware,” Amelia said through clenched politeness.

She reached. Fingers brushed the box she wanted. Missed it by an inch.

“…Almost,” she murmured.

Her muscles finally gave out, and she sank back to her usual height with a soft, controlled drop. She exhaled, adjusting her glasses like nothing unusual had just happened.

Ashley retrieved the box easily and handed it to her. “You don’t gotta do that.”

“I know,” Amelia said, taking it. “But sometimes I like to remind myself I *can*.”

Lewis smirked. “You look taller for, like, ten seconds.”

Amelia nodded. “Ten seconds is still taller.”

Later, when she was tired and coiled comfortably on the couch, Ashley nudged her gently.

“You alright?”

“Yes,” Amelia said. “My muscles are just… filing a complaint.”

Ashley smiled.

Amelia might have been short most of the time.

But for a little while — when she chose to — she could rise above it.

And that was enough.
