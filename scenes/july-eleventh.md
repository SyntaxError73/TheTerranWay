### **July Eleventh**

Eric’s hatch day always came when everything else was gone.

School was out. The buses stopped running their usual routes. The big city emptied into vacations and obligations and distances that suddenly mattered more than intentions.

July eleventh.

On Terra, that meant heat shimmering over fields, cicadas rattling in the trees, and the countryside stretching wide and quiet around the Hunter home.

It also meant no party.

Not the kind other kids talked about, anyway.

Eric never complained. Not once.

He understood logistics early — understood that his friends lived too far away, that transit was expensive, that nobody’s parents wanted to make a long trip just to stand in a field and eat cake when everyone was already tired from the year.

So his hatch days were small.

Jeannie would bake something. John would clap him on the back and call him “birthday boy” like it was enough to fill the space. Ashley would trail after him all day, insisting on tagging along. Lewis would give him something handmade, usually strange and sincere.

It was good.

It just wasn’t… *shared*.

Sometimes Eric would lie awake that night, listening to crickets, thinking about how everyone else seemed to collect memories with crowds in them. Laughter layered over laughter. Photos full of people.

His memories were quieter.

Fields. Heat. Family.

He told himself that was better.

College was different.

By then, Terra’s internet was new — clumsy, slow, and miraculous all at once. Email inboxes filled with plain text and promise.

On July eleventh, Eric opened his laptop expecting nothing in particular.

There were messages.

Short ones. Awkward ones. Some clearly written by people who weren’t sure how emotional email was supposed to be.

> *Happy hatch day, man!*
> *Hope you’re doing good.*
> *Miss training with you.*

Eric stared at the screen longer than necessary.

More arrived throughout the day. From teammates. From classmates. From people he hadn’t realized remembered.

No confetti. No cake. No one singing.

But for the first time, the day didn’t feel empty.

He leaned back in his chair, arms folded behind his head, and let himself smile.

Years later, displaced to Earth, the date still came quietly.

Ashley remembered it now. So did Lewis. Amelia marked it in her calendar with a little note that just said *Eric*.

They didn’t throw a big party.

They never did.

But that evening, John raised a glass and said, “July eleventh. Still counts.”

Eric nodded. “Yeah. It does.”

And it did.

Because Eric had learned something important over the years:

Some days aren’t loud.
Some celebrations don’t look like celebrations.

But being remembered — even softly — was enough.

It always had been.
