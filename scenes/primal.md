### **Primal**

He didn’t wait to be told it was all right.

When the forest had settled and the last echoes of motion had faded, he knelt and ate simply — no tools, no ceremony beyond the brief bow of his head. It wasn’t hunger the way people talked about hunger. It was necessity, instinct, continuity. The same way the woods accepted rain.

Ashley watched without judgment.

On Terra, she’d seen worse done with less care.

He noticed her watching eventually and stilled, lifting his head slightly. For a moment, uncertainty crossed his face — that familiar flicker of *Did I misstep?* — before he tore a clean piece free and held it out to her, palm open.

“For you,” he said quietly. “If you want it… cooked.”

She smiled.

“Always prepared,” she replied, already shrugging one strap of her pack free.

The survival kit was second nature to her. From the bags strapped securely at her hips, she produced tools with practiced ease — firestarter, blade, compact cookware. Within minutes, a small fire crackled to life, modest and controlled, smoke rising straight into the canopy.

Primal stayed close but didn’t crowd her. He watched the flames the way someone watches a language they don’t speak fluently but understand well enough to trust.

They didn’t talk.

There was no need.

The silence between them wasn’t empty — it was *shared*. The forest breathed around them. Leaves shifted. Something small scurried and disappeared. Ashley turned the meat carefully, the smell changing as heat touched it, grounding the moment in something familiar.

She handed it back to him when it was done, and he accepted it with both hands this time, reverent in a way that had nothing to do with ritual and everything to do with gratitude.

“You’re… very,” she began, then paused, searching for the word.

He tilted his head. “Strange?”

“Primal,” she decided, and the word felt right the moment she said it. “In a good way.”

His eyes widened slightly.

Then he smiled — small, uncertain, but real.

Primal.

They ate together, different methods, same source, neither superior to the other. When they were finished, Primal gathered what remained and moved to a spot beneath a thick-rooted tree. He dug carefully, hands precise, and buried the rest deep enough to keep it cool, safe, and undisturbed.

“For later,” he said. “The earth will hold it.”

Ashley nodded. “She usually does.”

As the fire burned down to embers, Ashley leaned back against a fallen log, and Primal sat beside her, close enough that their shoulders brushed. No rush. No plan. Just the quiet knowledge that, for now, they were exactly where they needed to be.

In the woods.
Under an unfamiliar sky.
Sharing a meal that neither of their worlds would have questioned.

And for the first time since crossing the rift, Ashley thought:

*Maybe this place can hold us too.*
