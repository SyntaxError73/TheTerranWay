### **Not That Kind of Survival**

Ashley was confident she’d do great.

Not in a bragging way — just… matter-of-fact. She knew how to make shelter, start fires, forage safely, track animals, read weather, handle hunger. She’d done all of it for real, not as a challenge, not for cameras.

So when she saw the casting call for a survival reality series, she laughed and sent it to Lewis.

“I could win this,” she said.

Lewis blinked. “You know they edit those, right?”

Ashley shrugged. “Survival’s survival.”

That was her first mistake.

The application process was strange.

They didn’t ask much about skills. They asked about *conflict*.

“What makes you angry?”
“How do you handle losing?”
“Have you ever yelled at someone you loved?”

Ashley frowned at the screen. “Why does that matter.”

Lewis leaned over her shoulder. “They’re building characters.”

She didn’t love that, but she answered honestly anyway.

---

The interview was worse.

They nodded politely when she talked about weather patterns and knot strength. Barely reacted when she explained food preservation. But the moment she mentioned growing up country, getting picked on, or disliking competition?

Their eyes lit up.

“Oh,” one producer said. “Tell us more about that.”

Ashley felt her stomach tighten.

---

Then came the “trial shoot.”

They dropped her in a controlled environment — not dangerous, but uncomfortable — and told her to narrate everything she was doing.

“Explain your strategy,” the camera operator said.

Ashley stared at him. “I’m just… doing it.”

“Say it out loud.”

She tried. It felt wrong. Like explaining breathing.

When another contestant fumbled something obvious, Ashley instinctively stepped in to help.

The producer frowned.

“Don’t help them,” he whispered.

Ashley turned. “Why wouldn’t I?”

He didn’t answer.

---

By the end of the day, she was exhausted in a way survival had never made her.

Not hungry.
Not cold.
Just… watched.

Someone asked her to repeat a reaction she’d already had.

“Can you say that again, but angrier?”

“No,” Ashley said flatly.

They laughed like she was joking.

She wasn’t.

---

That night, she called home.

“I don’t like it,” she admitted quietly.

Eric didn’t interrupt.

“They don’t want survival,” she continued. “They want stress. They want people to snap.”

Eric nodded even though she couldn’t see him. “Then it ain’t for you.”

She exhaled, relieved someone said it first.

---

Ashley finished the trial. She was polite. Professional.

She declined the follow-up call.

Later, Lewis asked her if she regretted it.

She shook her head. “Nah. Learned somethin’.”

“What?”

“That I don’t need a show to prove I can survive.”

She smiled faintly. “And I don’t wanna survive *like that* anyway.”

---

She went back to the woods the next morning.

No cameras.
No narration.
No one asking her to perform discomfort.

Just real ground, real air, and real quiet.

And that, she decided, was the only kind of reality she cared about.
