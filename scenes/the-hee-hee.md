### **Hee-Hee (Do Not Warn Anyone)**

Ashley leans in close to Eric in the kitchen, voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper.

“Okay,” she says, barely containing herself, “I need you to do somethin’ for me later.”

Eric doesn’t even look at her. Just keeps stirring whatever he’s working on.

“Yeah?”

“When there’s a lull,” she continues, eyes shining, “and everybody’s calm… I want you to do the **Michael Jackson** *hee-hee*.”

Eric pauses.

Slowly.

He looks at her.

“…The *hee-hee*.”

“Yes,” Ashley whispers urgently. “But like— dead serious. No warning. Full commit.”

Eric’s mouth twitches. He looks away, thinking. Measuring timing. Social blast radius.

Then, very quietly:
“Okay.”

Ashley clamps a hand over her mouth to keep from losing it *immediately*.

Secret secured.

---

Later.

Everyone’s in the living room. John’s mid-story. Jeannie’s listening with that fond, half-distracted smile. Lewis is half on his phone, half present. The vibe is *normal*.

Ashley is vibrating.

She catches Eric’s eye for half a second and gives the tiniest nod.

Eric waits.

John finishes his sentence.

There’s a brief, innocent silence.

And then—

Eric, in his deep, relaxed, candle-flame voice, suddenly snaps into a perfect, crystal-clear falsetto:

“**Hee-HEE!**”

The room **explodes**.

John jumps and then immediately starts laughing so hard he has to sit down.
Lewis lets out a shocked bark of laughter, completely unprepared.
Jeannie gasps, hand to her chest, then loses it too.

“What— *ERIC*—” she manages, laughing.

Ashley absolutely *folds*.

She doubles over, wheezing, tears in her eyes, laughing harder than anyone because *everyone else is laughing* and that’s the best part. She slaps the couch, tries to breathe, fails.

“I— I told him—” she chokes out. “I told him to— oh my god—”

Eric just shrugs, calm as ever, a faint smile betraying him. “Timing felt right.”

Lewis wipes his eyes. “You cannot just *do* that with no warning.”

John points accusingly at Ashley. “This was you.”

Ashley nods proudly through tears. “Worth it.”

Jeannie shakes her head, still laughing. “I can’t believe you kept a secret.”

Eric’s smile widens just a fraction.

Ashley laughs again, because she loves this — the shared joy, the surprise, the way laughter spreads like a chain reaction she helped set off.

The prank is over.

The secret is out.

And for the rest of the night, every time there’s a quiet moment, someone threatens:

“…Don’t.”

Eric doesn’t do it again.

But he *could*.

And that knowledge alone keeps Ashley giggling for hours.
