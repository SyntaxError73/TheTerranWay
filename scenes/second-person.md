### **Second Person**

The woods were empty in the good way.

No wind worth mentioning. No birds fussing. Just the soft give of earth under Ashley’s boots and the familiar weight of her pack settling against her hips as she moved deeper between the trees.

She stopped at a fork where the trail thinned out into nothing in particular.

“…Alright,” she said aloud. “You remember this part.”

She tilted her head, listening—not for danger, but for confirmation.

“You go left, you’ll hit the creek. You go right, you’re gonna regret it.”

She frowned at herself. “…Don’t start.”

She went left anyway.

The forest closed in, branches brushing her shoulders, the smell of damp leaves and old wood grounding her. A fallen log lay across her path, slick with moss.

“You can step over that,” she told herself. “You’ve done worse.”

She stepped. Slipped just a little. Caught herself easily.

“See?” she said. “Nothin’ to it.”

She paused.

“…Why are you narratin’?”

The woods, unsurprisingly, did not answer.

Ashley shook her head, smiling despite herself, and kept walking. It always happened when she was alone long enough—thoughts splitting just enough to talk back. Not voices. Just… commentary.

“You’re doin’ it again,” she muttered. “Second person like you ain’t in your own body.”

She stopped near a small clearing, hands on her hips, and looked up through the canopy.

“You gonna make fun of yourself for this later?” she asked.

She considered.

“…Yeah. Probably.”

A laugh escaped her, quiet and unguarded.

“It’s fine,” she decided, speaking firmly now. “Keeps you company. Keeps you sharp.”

She adjusted her pack and started moving again, boots steady, confidence returning with each step.

“And don’t you forget,” she added, pointing at nothing in particular, “you *like* bein’ out here.”

The woods accepted this without judgment.

Ashley walked on, talking herself through the world like she always had—aware it was strange, aware it was hers, and content to let her thoughts keep pace with her feet until home came back into view.
