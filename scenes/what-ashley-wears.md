### **What She Wears (And Why She Doesn’t Care)**

Ashley never understood clothes as *identity*.

To her, they were just… stuff you put on so people would leave you alone about it.

Fabric was either useful or it wasn’t. Too tight meant it chafed. Too loose got caught on branches. Anything itchy was immediately disqualified. Anything that restricted movement was an insult.

If something tore, that was fine. It meant she was using it correctly.

She owned clothes the way she owned tools.

And honestly?

If society allowed it, she wouldn’t wear any at all.

Not because she wanted attention — quite the opposite. Ashley just didn’t like barriers between her body and the world. Wind on skin. Sun on feathers. Rain she could shake off instead of soaking into fabric that took hours to dry.

But her upper torso didn’t have the same feather coverage as the rest of her.

And Earth had *rules*.

So she compromised.

Tank tops. Sports bras. Loose shirts she could shrug off the moment she got home. Shorts when she had to, nothing when she didn’t. Shoes only because stepping on glass was a losing game.

Amelia once watched her tug a shirt on with clear resentment.

“You look uncomfortable,” Amelia said gently.

Ashley shrugged. “I *am*.”

“…Why wear it, then?”

Ashley blinked, genuinely confused. “So folks don’t stare.”

Amelia considered that. “People stare anyway.”

Ashley snorted. “Yeah. But this way they stare less *aggressively*.”

That was the difference.

Amelia dressed to feel *assembled*.
Ashley dressed to be *left alone*.

---

Ashley admired Amelia’s outfits, though she’d never say it outright.

The layers. The coordination. The way Amelia looked like she had decided to exist *on purpose* that day.

“You look nice,” Ashley would say, simple and sincere.

Amelia would blush. “Thank you.”

Then Amelia would glance at Ashley’s scuffed shoes, her loose shirt, the faint grass stains she never noticed anymore.

“And you look… comfortable.”

Ashley grinned. “Darn right.”

They didn’t try to change each other.

Amelia understood that Ashley’s confidence came from movement, not presentation.

Ashley understood that Amelia’s calm came from structure, not freedom.

Two ways of surviving.
Two ways of taking up space.

And somehow, sitting side by side — one carefully dressed, one barely tolerating it — they fit together just fine.
