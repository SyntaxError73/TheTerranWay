### **Cade’s Cove**

It was supposed to be a pleasant drive.

Windows down just enough for mountain air to drift in. Sunlight slipping through trees. The kind of slow, looping road where nobody was in a hurry and nobody needed to be.

Ashley sat comfortably in the back, relaxed for once. She’d been proud of herself at the gas station — grabbed snacks, grabbed water, grabbed a lemonade because it was hot and staying hydrated was *responsible*.

She drank the whole thing.

Amelia noticed first.

Ashley had gone quiet. Too quiet. She stared out the window, posture stiff, jaw set in a way Amelia recognized immediately.

“You okay?” Amelia asked softly.

“Yeah,” Ashley said too fast. “Fine.”

Ten minutes passed.

Then twenty.

The road wound on, beautiful and merciless. No buildings. No restrooms. Just trees and pull-offs and families blissfully unaware of their own luck.

Ashley’s foot bounced.

She swallowed hard.

Still didn’t say anything.

That was the worst part, Amelia would later think — Ashley *always* planned ahead. Always prepared. Always the capable one. This wasn’t her.

Then suddenly—

“I gotta pee.”

Everyone turned.

Ashley’s voice cracked just enough to give her away.

“I gotta pee *now*.”

The car slowed immediately.

Amelia’s heart dropped. “Ashley—”

“I didn’t think—” Ashley cut herself off, embarrassed and panicked all at once. “I didn’t think it’d take this long.”

They pulled over as discreetly as possible.

Jeannie moved first, calm as ever, grabbing a towel from the back. “Alright,” she said gently. “C’mon, baby.”

Ashley barely waited for the door to close before she bolted, mortified and desperate, trusting her mother without question.

Amelia stayed behind, hands clasped tight, worry etched across her face.

And then—

Lewis’s voice.

Unthinking. Casual.

“She does it like a boy.”

The words landed harder than anything else that day.

Ashley didn’t respond. Couldn’t. The moment passed quickly, handled efficiently, quietly. Everyone pretended it hadn’t happened.

But Ashley didn’t forget.

She didn’t forget the heat in her face.
The sudden awareness of being *wrong*.
The sense that she’d broken an invisible rule she hadn’t known existed.
She had learned what she thought was correct from reading the Manga series that Lewis let her borrow.
She didn't know any better.

Years passed.

The memory stayed.

---

Jeannie noticed it later — how Ashley hesitated when they weren’t home. How she went quiet on trips. How she always planned routes, stops, contingencies.

One evening, Jeannie finally asked.

Ashley didn’t answer right away.

Then, slowly, she told her.

About Cade’s Cove.
About the lemonade.
About the comment.

Jeannie listened without interrupting.

When Ashley finished, voice small despite her size, Jeannie reached out and took her hands.

“Oh, honey,” she said softly. “I didn’t know that stuck with you.”

Ashley shrugged. “It did.”

Jeannie squeezed her hands gently. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”

Ashley looked up.

“There ain’t one right way to exist,” Jeannie continued. “And certainly not when you’re just tryin’ to take care of yourself.”

Ashley swallowed.

“I wish I’d known.”

Jeannie smiled, warm and steady. “You know now.”

---

These days, when Ashley’s out in the woods — no buildings, no rules, no eyes — she doesn’t feel shame.

She feels relief.

She knows her body. Knows the land. Knows herself.

And that old embarrassment?

It doesn’t own her anymore.

It’s just a memory — one she outgrew.

Just like people do.
