### **Pressed-On Gravy**

Ashley heard the music before she saw him.

Alternative rock, a little scratchy around the edges, drifting out of the workshop like it had a job to do. John was inside, sleeves rolled up, working on something that probably didn’t need fixing but was getting fixed anyway.

She slowed without realizing it.

“Oh—hey, I know this one,” she said, stepping in.

John glanced up, grinned beneath his beard. “Course you do.”

The chorus hit, and Ashley sang along without thinking, voice low and warm, tail giving an absent little sway. John joined in a second later, off-key and proud of it.

They didn’t look at each other. Didn’t need to.

It was just music, work, and time moving exactly the way it should.

Later—much later—Ashley was passing through the living room when she stopped short.

An old action movie was on. The kind with practical effects, dramatic lighting, and heroes who never seemed to reload.

John was reclined on the couch, remote in one hand, completely absorbed.

Ashley hesitated. Then sat.

She wasn’t planning to stay. She just… did.

A gun appeared on screen.

John didn’t even look at her. “Alright, Mayfly. What’s that?”

Ashley squinted. “That’s a Beretta. Early nineties model.”

John snapped his fingers. “Correct.”

Another scene. Another gun.

“Revolver,” Ashley said immediately. “Cheap one.”

John nodded approvingly. “You’ve been payin’ attention.”

She smiled, proud in a quiet way. She always liked these little quizzes. Liked that he trusted her knowledge.

Dinner smelled *ridiculous*.

John cooked like he meant it. Everything hot, rich, and filling. Ashley ate with enthusiasm, feathers fluffed slightly in contentment.

“This is really good,” she said.

John chuckled. “Careful. Your mama’ll hear you.”

Ashley grinned. “I didn’t say *better*.”

They both knew.

That evening, John poured himself a glass of wine. Ashley mixed herself a lime margarita and settled back as John booted up a game on the console.

She watched him play, offering commentary whether he asked for it or not.

“Oh that guy’s gonna betray you.”

John snorted. “I already don’t trust him.”

“What about that one?”

John squinted at the screen. “That there’s… Pressed-On Gravy.”

Ashley lost it. “What does that even *mean*?”

“Means he looks like he smells suspicious,” John said solemnly.

She laughed so hard she nearly spilled her drink.

John grinned, pleased with himself.

---

At some point, Ashley leaned back and just watched him play. The lines on his face. The way he focused. The familiar comfort of sitting beside him without needing to say anything.

She thought, not for the first time, about how he’d been the first thing she saw when she hatched. The first voice. The first steady presence.

John glanced over. “You gettin’ tired, My little toe claw biter?”

She smiled softly. “Nah. Just… happy.”

He nodded, understanding more than he said. “Yeah.”

They stayed there until the game ended, music humming softly in the background, the world small and good and exactly right.

A perfect day.

One Ashley would carry with her for a very long time.
