### **The Job**

Ashley stared at the notebook for a long time.

It wasn’t fancy. Spiral-bound. A little bent. She’d written **“JOB???”** on the top of the page in pink marker and immediately regretted the enthusiasm.

She sat at the kitchen table, bare feet tucked under her raptor body, tail curled tight around one leg like it could anchor her. The house was calm—Jeannie humming softly in the other room, John clanking dishes with no real urgency, the normal soundtrack of *home*.

She hated this feeling.

Not the idea of work exactly.

The idea of *forever*.

Work until retirement.
Work until your body gives out.
Work until you’re too tired to enjoy the things you worked for.

It made her chest feel tight and small.

“…I don’t wanna do that,” she muttered.

But she needed money.

Not for anything big or dramatic. Just:

* gas,
* her own gear,
* not having to ask every time she wanted something small.

Independence, even in tiny doses.

She flipped the page.

**Two days a week**, she wrote.
Then underlined it hard.

“Seven hours,” she added. “Max.”

That felt… survivable.

---

She brought it up that evening, voice casual like it wasn’t a big deal.

“I’m thinkin’ about gettin’ a job.”

The room didn’t freeze.

That helped.

John looked up first. “Yeah?”

Eric paused where he was leaning against the counter, already reading her posture instead of her words.

“…Couple shifts,” Ashley added quickly. “Not full-time. Just—some.”

Jeannie came closer, careful not to crowd. “What kind of job?”

Ashley shrugged. “I dunno. Somethin’… real. Somethin’ where I can leave when my shift’s over.”

No one jumped in with suggestions.
No pressure.
No *you should*.

Primal met her eyes from across the room. “…You want to?” he asked.

She hesitated. Then nodded. “I think I need to. For me.”

He nodded back. That was all.

---

The application itself was awful.

Too many boxes. Too many questions that assumed a human body and a human brain that worked on neat schedules. Ashley’s pen hovered over *availability* for a long time before she wrote:

**Limited. Consistent.**

She turned it in with her heart pounding like she’d just jumped another quarry.

---

Her first shift came on a Tuesday.

She paced for a full hour beforehand.

Checked her survival pack twice—then didn’t bring it because it felt *wrong* for indoors. Changed shirts. Changed back. Sat down. Stood up. Sat again.

“Hey,” John said gently. “You can back out.”

Ashley shook her head. “No. If I don’t go now, I won’t ever.”

He nodded, proud but not showing it too hard.

---

The job itself wasn’t glamorous.

Stocking. Sorting. Helping customers find things they’d walked past three times already.

Her feet ached by hour four. Her tail was sore. The noise scraped at her nerves. But it was… manageable.

When her shift ended, she clocked out and just stood there for a second.

Done.

No guilt.
No overtime.
No *stay a little longer*.

She walked outside into the evening air, exhausted and shaky and weirdly lighter.

---

At home, she collapsed onto the couch, feathers fluffed, eyes half-lidded.

“I did it,” she said, voice small but proud.

Jeannie handed her a mug without comment. John smiled. Eric gave her a nod that meant *I see you*. Primal sat close enough that she could lean if she wanted.

“…I don’t wanna do it forever,” Ashley admitted.

“No one’s askin’ you to,” Jeannie said.

Ashley sipped her drink, breathing steady again.

Two days a week.
Seven hours at a time.

Not a lifetime.

Just enough.

And for the first time, the idea of earning something didn’t feel like a trap.

It felt like a choice.

---

That would *hit* Lewis—not with jealousy, but with something quieter and more unsettling.

Here’s how it would play out, true to who he is.

---

Lewis found out by accident.

Ashley’s work shirt was draped over the back of a chair, still faintly smelling like cardboard and floor cleaner. He stopped short in the hallway, stared at it like it might explain itself.

“…No way.”

He poked his head into the living room. “Hey. Ash?”

She looked up from where she was half-asleep on the couch, booted feet tucked in, tail limp with exhaustion. “Mm?”

“You… get a job?”

She cracked one eye open. “…Yeah.”

Lewis leaned against the doorframe, arms folding automatically. His expression wasn’t mocking. Or disapproving.

It was… recalibrating.

“Huh,” he said.

Ashley braced herself. “I’m not goin’ full capitalist or nothin’. It’s just two days.”

“I didn’t say anything.”

“…You’re thinkin’ very loud.”

Lewis huffed a quiet laugh and slid down to sit on the floor, back against the couch. “I just—” He paused, choosing his words in a way he didn’t often bother with. “You always said work was a trap.”

She nodded. “Still do.”

“And now you’re… voluntarily doing it.”

She sighed, staring at the ceiling. “Yeah. Turns out traps can also buy groceries.”

Lewis chewed on that.

“I dunno how you do it,” he admitted. “The clocking in. The expectations. The—” He gestured vaguely. “Being owned for hours.”

Ashley glanced down at him. “I’m not owned. I leave when my shift’s done.”

“…That’s new,” he muttered.

There was a long silence.

Then Lewis said, quieter, “You were kinda my proof.”

She frowned. “Proof of what?”

“That you could say no,” he said. “That you could opt out and still be… okay.”

Ashley’s chest tightened.

“…Hey,” she said, sitting up despite her tired bones. “I still say no. A lot. This just—” She tapped her chest. “This is me saying yes *on my terms*.”

Lewis looked at her then. Really looked.

“…You scared?” he asked.

She nodded. “Terrified.”

“…You proud?”

She hesitated. Then nodded again. “Yeah. A little.”

Lewis exhaled slowly, fingers drumming against his knee. “That’s… annoying.”

She snorted. “You’ll live.”

He smirked, but it didn’t quite stick. “Guess it means I can’t use you as my ‘see, even Ashley won’t do that’ argument anymore.”

Ashley nudged him gently with her foot. “You don’t gotta do what I do. Ever.”

“I know,” he said. Then, after a beat, “But… it helps. Seeing you do scary stuff without selling your soul.”

She smiled at that. Soft. Tired. Real.

Lewis leaned his head back against the couch. “…If you ever hate it, you can quit.”

“I know.”

“And if you like it,” he added reluctantly, “that’s allowed too.”

Ashley reached down and ruffled his hair. “Look at you. Being emotionally supportive.”

“Don’t tell anyone,” he groaned.

They sat there like that for a while—two siblings renegotiating the shape of adulthood, quietly, without anyone declaring a winner.

Lewis still didn’t want a job.

Ashley still didn’t want a career.

But the world had shifted just enough to prove something important:

There wasn’t only one way to survive it.

And they didn’t have to abandon each other’s paths to walk their own.

---

Ashley’s job stayed simple.

That was the best part.

She bagged groceries. Stocked shelves when asked. Helped people find things that were always somehow right in front of them. She worked her two shifts, seven hours each, and when the clock said she was done—she was *done*.

No guilt.
No overtime.
No “can you stay a little longer?”

At first, she went home wrecked.

Her feet hurt. Her tail ached. Her head buzzed like she’d been shaken too hard. The noise, the lights, the constant *people*—it all piled up faster than she wanted to admit.

So she bought herself a six-pack of margaritas after her shifts.

Nothing dramatic. Just… a way to come down.

She’d sit on the porch, barefoot, drink something cold, and let the world fade back to a tolerable volume.

No one judged her for it.

No one made it a thing.

---

The people at the store noticed her in the way people notice weather.

Not all at once. Just gradually.

Ashley always said hi.
Always helped load heavy bags without being asked.
Always apologized when she bumped something with her tail—even if it was the shelf’s fault.

She joked with the older customers. Listened when they talked. Remembered who needed paper bags instead of plastic. Who liked their bread on top. Who didn’t want help but appreciated being offered anyway.

Her energy was… grounding.

Not loud the way she could be at home.
Not guarded either.

Just *present*.

After a while, people started timing their lines so they’d end up with her.

“Hey, can you take me?”
“I like her.”
“She’s gentle.”

Her coworkers started bringing her snacks on break.

Someone learned she liked pink and taped a ridiculous glittery note to her locker. Someone else started saving slightly bruised fruit for her because “you eat like you mean it.”

Ashley stopped buying margaritas every shift.

Not because anyone told her to.

She just… didn’t need them as much.

She still grabbed food after work, though.

That part she *loved*.

She’d wander the aisles slowly, basket hooked over one arm, barefoot boots scuffing softly on the floor. She bought whatever her body wanted—fruit, bread, cheese, things she’d never have justified before because they were “extra.”

It felt good.

Earned.

---

One night, as she clocked out, her supervisor smiled at her.

“Hey,” she said. “You know you’re doing great, right?”

Ashley froze, just a little. “…I am?”

“Yeah,” the woman said easily. “People like you. We like you. You make this place nicer.”

Ashley swallowed. “…Thanks.”

It sat with her all the way home.

Not as pressure.
Not as expectation.

As warmth.

---

She never picked up more shifts.

When asked, she shook her head. “This is my limit.”

And somehow—

That was fine.

They worked around her.
Scheduled her carefully.
Saved her spot.

Ashley learned something important in that grocery store:

She didn’t have to give *everything* to be valued.
She didn’t have to burn herself down to be appreciated.

Two days a week.
Seven hours at a time.

She belonged anyway.

And for someone who’d spent most of her life feeling like she had to earn her place by being useful, brave, or quiet—

That was everything.
