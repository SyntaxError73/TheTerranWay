### **February Fourteenth (And the Day After)**

The Hunters discovered Valentine’s Day the same way they discovered most Earth customs.

Confusingly.

It started with the grocery store.

Ashley came home carrying a bag full of things she absolutely did not remember putting in her cart. Chocolate hearts. Pink-wrapped candy. A card with glitter on it that she swore had *leapt* into her hands when she wasn’t looking.

Jeannie, however, was delighted.

“Oh, I *love* this,” she said, holding up a heart-shaped box like it was a sacred artifact. “A whole day just for affection?”

Eric squinted. “Ain’t every day for that?”

“Yes,” Jeannie replied patiently. “But this one’s *intentional*.”

Lewis slouched at the table, scrolling on his phone. “It’s a capitalist guilt ritual designed to sell sugar and remind single people of their failure.”

Ashley blinked. “Buddy.”

“I’m just sayin’,” he continued, not looking up. “Statistically speaking—”

Primal set a bowl of snacks in front of him. “Would you like some snacks?”

Lewis paused. Looked at the bowl. Sighed. “…Yeah.”

Amelia watched the exchange quietly, unsure what to make of the holiday. Cards seemed stressful. Expectations seemed worse.

“What do people… do?” she asked.

Ashley shrugged. “From what I gather? Eat chocolate. Watch movies. Pretend pink is a personality.”

Jeannie clasped her hands. “We’re celebrating.”

Lewis groaned. “Of course we are.”

That night, they gathered in the living room.

Not for romance — just proximity.

Jeannie made tea. Eric pretended not to enjoy the candy. Ashley passed out snacks like it was a peace offering. Primal sat calmly, tail giving the occasional content wag.

Amelia, curious now, checked her phone.

“…Oh no.”

Ashley glanced over. “What?”

Amelia stared at the screen. “…My hatch day is tomorrow.”

“Yeah?” Ashley smiled. “That’s great!”

Amelia swallowed. “It’s also… ‘Annoy Squidward Day.’”

Silence.

Lewis’s head snapped up. “*What.*”

Amelia turned the screen around.

Lewis stared. Then slowly leaned back in his chair. “…That’s incredible.”

Ashley burst out laughing. “No way. That’s *perfect*.”

Amelia groaned. “Why is my existence a meme.”

Lewis was already typing. “Hold on. When’s *your* birthday, Ash?”

“May twenty-fifth.”

Lewis froze.

Then his grin went feral.

“…Ashley.”

“What.”

“That’s ‘The Day SpongeBob and Patrick Go Camping.’”

Ashley stared.

Then she laughed so hard she had to sit down. “You are *lyin’*.”

Primal tilted his head. “What are they camping from?”

Amelia smiled despite herself. “Responsibility.”

---

They binged the show that night.

All of them.

Jeannie pretended she wasn’t watching, then laughed the hardest. Eric quoted lines badly. Lewis explained lore nobody asked for. Primal watched with quiet fascination. Ashley laughed until she snorted.

Amelia curled up on the couch, eyes shining.

When midnight rolled around, Ashley nudged her gently. “Happy hatch day, Squidward.”

Amelia smiled, warm and unguarded. “Thank you.”

Lewis sighed theatrically. “I still hate Valentine’s Day.”

Jeannie kissed the top of his head. “That’s alright. Love shows up anyway.”

Lewis rolled his eyes. “…Yeah.”

And for the first time since Terra, a holiday didn’t feel like something they were missing.

It felt like something they’d *made their own*.

Even if it involved squid.
