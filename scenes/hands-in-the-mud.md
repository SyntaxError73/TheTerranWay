### **Hands in the Mud**

Ashley found out by accident.

She was at a bait shop near the river, buying absolutely nothing she needed, when she overheard two men arguing near the counter.

“I’m tellin’ you,” one of them said, “that hole’s still active. Big one.”

“Ain’t no way,” the other replied. “Ain’t nobody dumb enough to stick their arm in there this early.”

Ashley froze.

She turned slowly. “Excuse me,” she said, polite as pie. “Y’all talkin’ ‘bout noodlin’?”

The shop went quiet.

Both men stared at her — tall, feathered, unmistakably *not human*. One of them blinked.

“…Yes, ma’am,” he said carefully. “We are.”

Ashley smiled. Big. Excited. The kind of smile that meant something fun was about to happen.
“Well I’ll be. I thought that was just a Terra thing.”

They stared harder.

Down at the riverbank, the group was wary at first.

Not unfriendly — just unsure. Noodling wasn’t something you invited strangers into lightly, and Ashley was… different. Bigger. Built strange. Strong in ways that didn’t advertise themselves.

“You ever done this before?” one of them asked.

Ashley crouched near the water, peering into the murk like she was reading it. “Since I was knee-high,” she replied. “Though I prefer a firearm if I’m bein’ honest.”

That earned a laugh.

“Alright,” someone said. “You can try that hole there. But don’t rush it.”

Ashley rolled her shoulders, feathers fluffing once as she waded in. The water climbed up her legs, soaked into her feathers, cool and familiar. She didn’t hesitate — just moved with purpose, reading the river like it was speaking to her.

She slid her arm into the burrow.

Paused.

Smiled.

“Oh,” she said softly. “That’s a good one.”

There was a sudden, violent thrash.

Water exploded upward as Ashley *leaned back*, muscles engaging smoothly, feet digging into the riverbed. The men shouted — warnings, excitement, disbelief — but Ashley just laughed, breathless and thrilled.

The catfish came up fighting, huge and angry, its mouth locked around her forearm.

Ashley whooped. “C’mon now!”

With one clean motion, she hauled it free, gripping the lower jaw and lifting the fish clear of the water like it weighed nothing.

The riverbank went silent.

“…Well I’ll be damned,” someone whispered.

Ashley held the catfish up triumphantly, water dripping from her feathers, grin wild and unrepentant. “Y’all eatin’ this or just admirin’?”

By the end of the afternoon, word had spread.

People came down just to watch. Some stayed to fish. Some just stared. Ashley noodled hole after hole, never reckless, never rushed — respectful of the river, the animals, and the people watching her work.

She explained things patiently. Showed hand placement. Warned about snapping turtles. Laughed when someone chickened out at the last second.

By sunset, she’d pulled more catfish than anyone else there.

Someone handed her a cold drink like it was a ritual.

“You know,” one of them said, shaking his head, “you might be the best noodler I ever seen.”

Ashley shrugged, suddenly shy. “Guess I just like the river.”

Another laughed. “Lady, you’re gonna be a story.”

She didn’t realize it until later — until she came back another weekend and people recognized her — that she’d crossed some invisible line.

Not a human one.

A river one.

Ashley hadn’t gone looking to be a legend.

She’d just found something familiar in a strange world… and reminded everyone there that some thrills are older than species.

And the river?

The river remembered her now.
