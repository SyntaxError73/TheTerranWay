## A first visit to Frozen Head

Ashley doesn’t announce it as a *trip*. She just says, “Y’all wanna go see somethin’ real nice?”

The road winds upward, pavement narrowing, trees pressing close. The air changes. Cooler. Cleaner. Older.

When they step out at the trailhead, Ashley breathes deep and smiles like she’s greeting an old friend.

“Smells right,” she says.

Eric nods, scanning the terrain. “Solid ground.”

Lewis is already crouched, fascinated by moss clinging to a rock like it’s holding a secret. “Do you know how long this has been here?”

Jeannie trails a hand along a wooden railing, eyes soft. “It’s beautiful.”

Amelia stays near the start, taking it in slowly. The slope. The roots. The way the trail rises without apology.

“I can do a little,” she says. “Just… not the steep parts.”

Ashley doesn’t hesitate. “That’s alright. We’ll do the easy loop.”

No argument. No disappointment. Just adjustment.

Primal stands quietly beside Amelia, tail relaxed. “How are you doing?”

She smiles. “Better than I expected.”

They walk. Not far. Far enough.

At a clearing, Amelia rests on a sun-warmed rock while the others explore nearby. She watches light filter through leaves, listens to wind move like a low voice through the trees.

“This place,” she murmurs, “feels like it remembers things.”

Primal nods. “Yeah.”

Ashley comes back muddy and glowing. “We’re comin’ here again.”

Eric grins. “Often.”

Lewis is already planning routes. Jeannie is already thinking of sketches.

And Amelia — clumsy, careful, content — realizes something important:

Wartburg isn’t just where they landed.

It’s where they’re *staying*.
