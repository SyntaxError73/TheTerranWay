### **Thought Bubbles**

Lewis doesn’t actually *see* thought bubbles.

But sometimes it’s close enough that he jokes about it like he does.

He’ll be sitting quietly, watching a conversation unfold, and his eyes will unfocus just a little—like he’s looking *past* people instead of at them.

Then he’ll say something like,
“Your bubble’s loud right now.”

Ashley will glance at him. “My *what*?”

“Your thought bubble,” Lewis says, matter-of-fact. “It’s flickerin’. Means you’re about to say something you’ve been rehearsin’.”

Ashley opens her mouth.

Closes it.

“…Dang it.”

He’s not psychic. He knows that. He just reads patterns absurdly well—micro-pauses, breath changes, posture shifts, the way someone’s gaze keeps returning to the same spot. His brain stitches it together into a little floating subtitle over people’s heads.

*Wants to help but doesn’t know how.*
*Is pretending not to be annoyed.*
*Has a question but is scared it’s stupid.*

He doesn’t always say it out loud. He’s learned not to.

But sometimes—when someone’s spiraling quietly—he’ll tilt his head and gently test it.

“You’re thinkin’ this is your fault,” he’ll say.

Eric will look at him, startled. “I… yeah.”

Ashley once asked him what her thought bubble usually looks like.

Lewis thought about it. “It’s messy. Like… three tabs open, one playin’ music, one stuck loadin’, and one that just says ‘WHY’ in all caps.”

Ashley laughed. “Accurate.”

He sees it strongest when people say one thing and think another. When words don’t match posture. When silence is doing more talking than sound.

Crowds exhaust him because of it. Too many bubbles. Too much overlap.

At home, it’s quieter. Familiar. Predictable in a comforting way.

Jeannie’s bubble is usually organized but tired.
John’s is loud and affectionate.
Eric’s is steady, heavy, grounded.
Ashley’s is kinetic—sparks, loops, sudden clarity followed by chaos.

Lewis never claims it’s perfect.

Sometimes he’s wrong.
Sometimes he projects.
Sometimes he misses things entirely.

But more often than not, he sees the *shape* of what people are thinking—even if he doesn’t know the words.

And that’s why, when Ashley’s stuck, or Eric’s quiet, or Jeannie’s overwhelmed, Lewis is often the first to say the thing that gently pops the bubble and lets the air out.

Not because he’s invasive.

But because he’s paying attention.

And in a family that lives a lot in subtext, that quiet skill matters more than anyone ever says out loud.
