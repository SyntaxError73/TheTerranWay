### **One Trip Wonder**


This is not bravado.

This is **law**.

Ashley Hunter does not make two trips.

She will stare down a week’s worth of groceries in the trunk like it personally challenged her lineage. Calculation flickers behind her eyes. Weight. Balance. Handle integrity. Bag density.

“Alright,” she mutters. “We can do this.”

She loads up both primary hands first. Then the secondary arms—careful not to crush anything important. Eggs get special treatment. Bread gets protected like it’s fragile wildlife.

Lewis watches from the porch. “You know you could—”

“No,” Ashley says instantly. “I could *not*.”

When all four arms are full, she doesn’t stop.

She hooks additional bags over her tail—looped, balanced, adjusted so they won’t slide. It flexes with practiced precision, counterbalancing her load like it’s done this a hundred times before.

Eric raises an eyebrow. “You’re maxed.”

“I’m *optimized*,” she corrects.

She waddles toward the door leading into the house, bags swaying slightly. No panic. No hesitation. She lifts one foot—raptor toes curling with dexterity—and grips the doorknob.

*click.*

The door swings open a bit. Ashley pushes it open further with the same foot.

Lewis blinks. “You opened that with your foot.”

Ashley grins. “It’s basically a hand.”

She marches inside, deposits everything exactly where it belongs, and straightens up like she just completed a sacred rite.

“One trip,” she declares. “As God intended.”

John, watching proudly, nods. “That’s my girl.”

Jeannie sighs. “You don’t have to prove anything.”

Ashley tilts her head. “I know.”

Then, quieter, with a smirk:
“But if I *can*… why wouldn’t I?”

Because for Ashley, it’s not about strength.

It’s about efficiency.
Determination.
And the unshakable belief that the groceries—and the world—will come inside on her terms.
