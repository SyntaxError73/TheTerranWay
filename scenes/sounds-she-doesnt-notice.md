### **Sounds She Doesn’t Notice Making**

Ashley didn’t realize she did it.

Not really.

It happened when she thought she was alone — truly alone — when the world loosened its grip just enough for her shoulders to drop.

She’d be moving through the house, doing something simple. Washing her hands. Looking out a window. Packing a bag. And a sound would slip out of her without permission.

A whistle, low and wandering.
A hum with no words, looping the same few notes until they settled.
A soft *brrrrr* of buzzing lips, like she was feeling the air vibrate just to prove it could.

Sometimes she’d tilt her head and shape her mouth just right, producing a muted, brassy *wah* sound — not quite singing, not quite noise — a careful imitation of a trumpet she’d never actually learned to play.

It soothed something inside her. Gave her thoughts a track to run on.

She never planned it.

And she never finished.

Because the moment she sensed someone nearby — a footstep, a breath, the faintest shift in the room — the sound stopped.

Instantly.

Not with embarrassment. Not with intention.

It just… vanished.

Ashley wouldn’t even notice.

---

Amelia noticed.

She’d paused in the hallway one afternoon, notebook tucked against her side, listening.

Ashley was in the kitchen, back turned, humming something gentle and cyclical — a melody that didn’t exist anywhere else. It rose and fell, confident in its privacy.

Then Amelia stepped forward.

The humming stopped mid-note.

Ashley didn’t react. Didn’t flinch. Didn’t even realize.

She turned, cheerful. “Oh hey. You need somethin’?”

Amelia blinked. “…No.”

She hesitated. “You were… humming.”

Ashley frowned slightly. “Was I?”

“Yes.”

Ashley shrugged. “Huh.”

And that was it.

---

Lewis noticed too.

Once, passing by Ashley’s room late at night, he heard the unmistakable *buzz-buzz-wah* of trumpet noises, playful and experimental.

He paused.

Then stepped deliberately on a loose floorboard.

The sound cut off immediately.

Ashley opened the door. “You need somethin’?”

Lewis stared at her for a second, then smiled. “Nope. Just checkin’.”

She nodded, unbothered, and closed the door.

Lewis walked away thinking, *Interesting.*

---

Ashley masked it without knowing she was masking.

Those sounds belonged to the version of her that didn’t feel watched. The version that didn’t need to be capable, strong, or composed.

They were the noises of a mind stretching its legs.

And she didn’t stop because she was ashamed.

She stopped because her brain quietly switched modes — from *safe* to *aware* — the way it always had.

Later, much later, when Amelia mentioned it gently — not as a question, just an observation — Ashley laughed.

“Well I’ll be,” she said. “Guess my brain’s got its own soundtrack.”

Amelia smiled. “It’s nice.”

Ashley thought about that for a moment.

Then shrugged, grinning. “Long as nobody asks me to perform.”

And she went back to her day — unaware that when she was alone again, the music would come right back.
