### **Clear Skies, Hypothetically**

It started with radar.

Lewis had three different weather maps open on his laptop, each one colored in aggressive reds and greens like it was daring the atmosphere to do something interesting. Ashley leaned over his shoulder, mug in hand, eyes narrowed in concentration.

“That cell’s rotating,” she said.

Lewis nodded. “Yeah. But it’s sloppy. Needs better shear.”

Ashley grinned. “Give it time.”

They watched in silence for a moment, the house quiet except for the low hum of electronics and distant birdsong. Then Lewis leaned back in his chair.

“You ever think about it?” he asked.

Ashley tilted her head. “About what.”

“Storm chasin’,” he said. “Like, *really* chasin’.”

Her eyes lit instantly.

“Oh, you mean not just watchin’ ‘em?” she said. “You mean drivin’ straight toward the meanest part of the sky?”

Lewis smiled. “Exactly.”

Ashley set her mug down slowly. “Alright. Hypothetically.”

Lewis perked up. “Hypothetically, we’d need a truck.”

“Lifted,” Ashley added. “With mud tires.”

“And reinforced suspension.”

“And a dashcam,” she said. “Actually, *five* dashcams.”

Lewis was already typing notes. “We’d paint it somethin’ obnoxious.”

Ashley laughed. “Like neon yellow.”

“Or storm-gray with lightning decals.”

They both paused, imagining it.

Ashley leaned back, folding her arms. “I’d drive.”

Lewis nodded immediately. “Yeah. You’d have the instincts.”

“You’d do the radar,” she continued. “Spotter reports. Predict where the storm’s gonna turn before it does.”

Lewis grinned. “I *do* love patterns.”

“And when we pull over,” Ashley said, voice lowering like she was already there, “wind howlin’, sky green as sin—”

Lewis finished it, breathless. “—we step out just enough to feel the pressure change.”

Ashley shivered. “That’s the good stuff.”

They fell quiet again, both staring at the screen, storms flickering like living things.

“…We’d probably argue,” Lewis said eventually.

Ashley snorted. “Constantly.”

“You’d wanna get closer.”

“You’d say it’s unsafe.”

“I’d be right.”

She smirked. “You usually are.”

Lewis smiled, softer now. “We’d be a good team.”

Ashley nodded, serious. “Yeah. We would.”

From the other room, Amelia called, “Please do not die in a tornado.”

Ashley called back, laughing. “It’s hypothetical!”

Primal’s voice followed, calm as ever. “Yeah.”

Lewis glanced at the radar again. “You know,” he said, “if we weren’t… us…”

Ashley smiled wistfully. “We’d be chasin’ storms across the plains.”

Lewis closed the laptop gently. “Maybe we still are. Just… from the porch.”

Ashley picked up her mug again, eyes drifting toward the sky. “Ain’t nothin’ wrong with watchin’ the weather.”

Lewis nodded. “The sky still tells its stories.”

And for a moment, clouds rolled in the distance — not threatening, not dramatic — just enough to make two weather nerds grin like they’d been invited into a secret.
