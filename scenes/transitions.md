### **The Hard Part Isn’t Where She’s Going**

Ashley doesn’t hate plans.

She hates *the moment before them*.

It doesn’t matter where she’s headed — her favorite steakhouse, the trailhead at the state park, somewhere she’s been excited about all week. The problem is never the destination.

It’s the transition.

The part where she has to stop what she’s doing, drop her current focus, and reorient herself instantly. Her brain resists it like a snapped rope — not because she doesn’t want to go, but because she was *already somewhere else*.

Mentally. Emotionally. Sensory-wise.

“Five minutes,” she’ll say.

Not to delay.
To prepare.

---

Ashley focuses deeply when she’s settled. Whatever she’s doing becomes her whole world — hands busy, thoughts aligned, body calm. Pulling her out of that state feels like being yanked mid-step.

Even good interruptions feel abrupt.

Her chest tightens. Her feathers twitch. She gets quiet, not sulky — *buffering*.

People sometimes mistake it for reluctance.

It’s not.

It’s recalibration.

---

She’s learned little tricks to cope.

Finishing a task completely before moving on.
Standing still for a moment instead of rushing.
Talking herself through what comes next.

“Okay,” she’ll mutter. “We’re switchin’ now.”

Sometimes she paces. Sometimes she goes silent. Sometimes she takes longer than she thinks she should.

Ashley hates that part — not because she’s ungrateful, but because every transition costs her something.

Energy. Focus. Ease.

Eric understands without asking.

He gives her warning. Doesn’t rush her. Walks beside her instead of ahead.

Lewis forgets sometimes — then catches himself and backtracks.

Amelia never pushes.

She just waits.

---

And once Ashley *arrives* — once her body catches up with her mind — she’s fine.

Happy, even.

Laughing over a steak.
Running a familiar trail.
Breathing in woods she loves.

People don’t see the work it took to get there.

But Ashley does.

And she shows up anyway.
