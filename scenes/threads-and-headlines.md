## **Threads & Headlines**

### **Lewis, Online**

Lewis didn’t *mean* to become a recurring figure in cryptid forums.

It just… happened.

He’d started by lurking, of course. Reading posts. Screenshots. Grainy footage. Threads titled things like *“SAUROMORPH SIGHTING CONFIRMED???”* and *“APPALACHIAN RAPTOR WOMAN REAL??”*

At first, it was funny.

Then it got *wrong*.

So Lewis made an account.

**Username:** `newt_thoughts`
**Profile pic:** A very unhelpful drawing of a salamander wearing sunglasses.

> **User123:** “These things aren’t human. Probably hostile.”
>
> **newt_thoughts:**
> *Counterpoint: she helped my neighbor fix a fence and returned a lost dog.*

That earned him a reply storm.

> **User456:** “How would YOU know?”
>
> **newt_thoughts:**
> *Because I live here and also I am one of the ‘things.’ Hi.*

That’s when it really took off.

Lewis answered questions patiently at first. Explained anatomy. Corrected misinformation. Debunked the more outlandish theories with dry humor.

> *No, we are not immune to bullets. Please stop asking.*
>
> *Yes, feathers are waterproof. No, we cannot fly.*
>
> *If we were aliens, do you really think we’d choose Ohio?*

Some people accused him of trolling.

Some believed him immediately.

Some didn’t care either way but thought he was funny.

Lewis leaned back in his chair, grinning, fingers flying across the keyboard.

“Alright,” he muttered to himself. “Let’s do science.”

### **Ashley, On TV**

Ashley absolutely did *not* expect the news van.

She was down by the river again, boots muddy, feathers damp, a respectable catfish on the line when someone called her name.

“Ma’am? Excuse me?”

She turned, squinting at the camera.

“…Oh no.”

The reporter smiled nervously. “We’ve had a lot of folks talking about your fishing skills. Mind if we ask you a few questions?”

Ashley straightened, suddenly aware of every inch of herself.

She glanced off-camera.

Somewhere far away, she imagined her parents watching.

She smiled.

“Well,” she said into the microphone, “I reckon y’all finally noticed.”

The segment was meant to be short.

It wasn’t.

Ashley talked about the river. About respecting wildlife. About safety. About how noodling wasn’t about being fearless—it was about *knowing what you were doing*.

Then the reporter asked, “What do you say to people calling you a cryptid?”

Ashley grinned, wicked and familiar.

“Well,” she said, “if I am, I reckon I’m a friendly one.”

She paused.

Then—because Lewis had dared her, years ago—

She added, “Guess you could say… I’m just *tryin’ to live my best myth.*”

The cameraman snorted.

The reporter laughed.

Ashley beamed.

### **Later**

The Hunters watched the replay that evening.

Eric shook his head, smiling. “You said the thing.”

Jeannie covered her mouth to hide her laugh. “Oh, Ashley…”

John leaned back, arms crossed, pride obvious. “That’s my girl.”

Amelia peeked at her phone. “Lewis, you’re trending.”

Lewis looked up from his laptop, eyes bright. “I know.”

Primal tilted his head. “Yeah. That sure is something.”

Ashley stretched, feathers fluffing with contentment. Somewhere, in another world, she could almost *feel* her parents’ familiar reaction—

An eye roll.
A fond sigh.
*Oh, you…*

And for once, being seen didn’t feel dangerous.

It felt like home, catching up to them.
