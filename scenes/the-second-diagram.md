### **The Second Diagram**

Lewis hadn’t planned on needing visual aids for a date.

He really hadn’t.

But somewhere between *“so how does that work?”* and *“wait, but where would—”* he felt the familiar pressure build behind his eyes. Not irritation exactly. Just the sense that words alone were about to fail him.

He excused himself for a moment, disappeared into his room, and came back holding a piece of paper.

“…Okay,” he said, sitting back down. “So. I learned this from Amelia.”

The girl across from him blinked. “Learned what?”

Lewis unfolded the paper.

It was a diagram. Of course it was.

Neat lines. Clear labels. A side-view silhouette of his body — humanoid torso flowing into raptor form, everything proportioned realistically instead of imaginatively. He’d even shaded areas of mass and balance.

“One system,” he said, tapping the page. “Not two. No duplicates.”

She leaned closer, curious rather than alarmed.

“My organs are centralized,” he continued, voice steady now. “Same logic as hers. Center of mass is the safest place. Evolution doesn’t waste effort.”

He traced a line downward. “End points go where they’d go on the animal portion. Digestive tract, tail musculature, all that.”

She nodded slowly. “That actually makes sense.”

Lewis relaxed a fraction.

“Most people overthink it,” he added. “They assume more complexity just because it looks different.”

She smiled. “You made a diagram.”

Lewis flushed. “I make diagrams when I’m nervous.”

“That’s kind of adorable.”

He blinked. “Oh.”

She handed the paper back gently. “Thank you for explaining it. I didn’t want to ask in a rude way.”

Lewis exhaled, shoulders twitching once before settling. “Yeah. Me neither.”

Later that night, he told Amelia about it.

She listened, hands folded, expression fond.

“You used labels,” she observed.

“And arrows,” Lewis said. “Color-coding felt like too much.”

She smiled. “I’m glad it helped.”

Lewis hesitated. “Is it weird that I… kind of liked explaining it?”

Amelia shook her head. “No. It means you trusted her.”

He thought about that. Then nodded.

From then on, Lewis kept a folded copy of his diagram in his bag.

Just in case.

Not because he expected to need it — but because sometimes, understanding came easier when you met confusion halfway.

And Amelia, quietly proud, considered that proof her diagram had done exactly what it was meant to do.
