### **Two Kinds of Trouble**

Amelia was clumsy.

Ashley was accident-prone.

They looked similar from the outside — bruises, apologies, messes that seemed to happen *around* them — but the causes couldn’t have been more different.

Amelia’s accidents came from misjudgment.

A chair just slightly too narrow.
A doorway she thought she could clear.
A mug she reached for without quite knowing where her tail had shifted.

She moved carefully, deliberately — and still, things slipped. Bumped. Tipped.

“Sorry,” she’d murmur, cheeks warm, gathering whatever she’d knocked over. “I didn’t mean—”

Ashley would already be helping. “You’re fine. That thing was in a bad spot anyway.”

Amelia tripped because the world didn’t match her internal map.

---

Ashley, on the other hand, knew *exactly* where everything was.

That was the problem.

She moved with confidence — too much of it, sometimes. She climbed where she shouldn’t. Took shortcuts that looked reasonable until they weren’t. Assumed her body could handle just a little more speed, just a little more reach.

She didn’t misjudge space.

She misjudged *risk*.

“Thought I could make it,” Ashley would say, slapping a bandage on a scrape like it was no big deal.

“You could not,” Amelia would reply flatly.

Ashley grinned. “But I almost did.”

Her injuries came from momentum. From enthusiasm. From trusting her instincts even when the situation didn’t deserve it.

One afternoon, it happened back to back.

Amelia knocked a stack of books off the table while turning too quickly. She froze, mortified.

“I’m so sorry—”

Ashley crouched immediately, unbothered. “Nah, you’re good.”

Five minutes later, Ashley came barreling in from outside, one sleeve torn, feathers ruffled.

“I fell in a ditch,” she announced cheerfully.

Amelia stared. “Why were you near a ditch.”

Ashley shrugged. “Shortcut.”

They looked at each other.

Then both sighed — for entirely different reasons.

---

Lewis once summed it up perfectly.

“Amelia’s accidents happen *to* her,” he said.
“Ashley’s accidents happen *because* of her.”

Ashley laughed. Amelia hid her face.

Primal, watching them both, nodded. “Yeah.”

---

The difference mattered.

Because Amelia learned to slow down, to map the world more carefully, to ask for help when needed.

And Ashley?

Ashley learned… almost nothing.

But she accepted the scrapes as part of living fully — and trusted that someone would be there to help her patch them up.

Different paths.

Same outcome.

Two people who stumbled — just in very different ways — and somehow always landed where they needed to be.
