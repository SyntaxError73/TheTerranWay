### **To the Coast**
---

The idea of a beach vacation started the way most Hunter plans did—casually, then all at once.

John mentioned it offhand over breakfast.
Jeannie paused, thought about it, then nodded.
Eric said it sounded nice.
Lewis asked about internet access.
Ashley immediately started preparing for *everything*.

By the end of the day, the trip was real.

East Coast. Actual ocean. Salt air, wide sky, no mountains hemming it in.

Ashley treated the announcement like a call to arms.

---

Preparation was her love language.

Her survival pack—already a permanent fixture strapped to her hips—got expanded. She laid everything out on her bed with military precision: extra rope, first aid, sunscreen rated for “people with more surface area than God intended,” electrolyte packets, waterproof bags, snacks she knew her body would accept, backup snacks, and *backup backup* snacks.

She added a laminated checklist.

Jeannie peeked in and smiled. “You know they sell things there, right?”

Ashley didn’t look up. “You don’t *assume* civilization.”

Eric passed the doorway, amused. “She’s happy.”

And she was.

Prepared Ashley was calm Ashley.

---

The drive was long, but not painful.

Eric enjoyed it the most. He liked watching the land change—trees thinning, air growing heavier, the smell shifting subtly with every mile. He took mental snapshots: roadside diners, unfamiliar accents, little churches tucked between gas stations and pine stands.

He liked *movement*. Progress without urgency.

Lewis, on the other hand, oscillated.

At first, he was fine—window down, watching clouds, pointing out birds, talking about coastal ecosystems. But hours without his PC started to itch. His phone only satisfied him in short bursts. Waiting, again, was a task.

He fidgeted. He slept. He stared. He sighed.

Ashley clocked it but didn’t tease.

“You’ll get there,” she said once, not unkindly. “The ocean’s loud enough to keep your brain busy.”

“…I hope so,” he muttered.

---

Amelia and Primal rode with them.

Amelia watched the scenery quietly, occasionally sketching when inspiration hit—waves before she’d even seen them, imagined horizons, the way the light would reflect off water. She was nervous, but the good kind. Anticipatory.

Primal stayed alert at first, eyes tracking unfamiliar surroundings. Cities faded. Open stretches replaced them. He relaxed as the world widened.

Different environment. Same people.

That mattered.

Jeannie and John took the front seats like it was their reward.

They talked. Not about logistics. Not about responsibilities. Just… talked. Shared observations. Quiet jokes. Comfort that only came from years of partnership.

Jeannie rested her hand on John’s arm at red lights. John squeezed back.

No rush.

---

When they finally arrived, the ocean announced itself before they saw it.

The air changed—salt-heavy, damp, alive. Wind rolled in steady waves, carrying sound with it. The sky felt larger. The horizon stretched impossibly far.

Ashley stopped dead the moment she stepped out of the car.

“…Whoa.”

She’d seen big water before. Lakes. Rivers. Flooded plains.

This was different.

This *moved*.

She laughed, sudden and loud, feathers ruffling as the wind caught them. “It’s breathin’!”

Eric smiled quietly, hands on his hips, eyes scanning the line where water met sky. “Yeah.”

Lewis stood still longer than expected, bored restlessness temporarily silenced. “That’s… a lot.”

Amelia hugged herself lightly, eyes wide. “It’s beautiful.”

Primal closed his eyes and let the wind wash over him, grounding. “It feels old.”

Ashley nodded. “Yeah. I like that.”

---

They settled in without incident.

No disasters. No chaos. Just unpacking, laughter, mild arguments over who got which room. Ashley claimed floor space without shame. Lewis checked the Wi-Fi and sighed—but it worked, at least a little.

The beach itself became the centerpiece.

Ashley loved it immediately.

Waterproof feathers meant she could wade without worry, letting waves crash against her legs, tail braced, body steady against the pull. She laughed when a wave hit harder than expected, staggering her back.

“HEY—!”

Eric stayed closer to shore, enjoying the rhythm more than immersion. He walked slowly, shoes off, letting wet sand compress under his weight, grounding him. He watched people. Watched his family.

Lewis tried to enjoy it.

He really did.

He walked. He collected shells. He took pictures. But eventually, he sat down with his back against a dune and pulled out his phone, then put it away, then stared at the ocean like it was a puzzle he couldn’t quite solve.

Ashley flopped down beside him, sand flying. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” he said. “Just… my brain wants a task.”

She nodded. “Fair.”

She handed him a stick. “Count waves.”

He blinked. “…What.”

“Count ‘em,” she said seriously. “See how long before you lose track.”

He huffed, but did it.

It worked longer than either of them expected.

---

Amelia found strange shells and little crabs, delighted. She stayed dry, mostly. She kept her tail up and off the sand. Primal followed her lead, protective without hovering, watching her expressions more than the water.

Jeannie and John sat together under an umbrella, feet buried in sand, just *being*. Jeannie read for a bit. John dozed. They shared snacks. Occasionally commented on clouds like it was a shared hobby.

At sunset, Ashley grew quiet.

The sky turned soft pinks and golds, light reflecting off the water like it was made of glass. She stood still, tail resting, feathers glowing warm in the fading sun.

Eric joined her.

“Good trip?” he asked.

She nodded. “Yeah. Real good.”

Lewis wandered over, phone forgotten. Amelia leaned into Primal’s side. Jeannie and John came closer, arm in arm.

They watched the sun sink together.

No speeches. No revelations.

Just the ocean doing what it had always done.

---

That night, they ate seafood.

Ashley was in heaven.

Shrimp. Fish. Butter. Garlic. Pasta involved at least once. She laughed with her mouth full, declared the ocean “a gift,” and made plans to come back someday.

Lewis perked up after eating, energy restored. Amelia tried something unfamiliar and loved it. Primal relaxed fully for the first time all day.

Later, they sat on the beach again—cooler now, quieter.

Waves whispered. Wind hummed. The world felt wide and gentle.

Ashley stretched out on the sand, staring up at the stars. “I like when the world reminds you it’s bigger than your problems.”

Eric nodded. “Yeah.”

Jeannie smiled. John squeezed her hand.

They didn’t need a perfect ending.

They got exactly where they were going.

And that was more than enough.
