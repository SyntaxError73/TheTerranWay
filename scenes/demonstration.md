### **Demonstration**

Eric hadn’t planned on stopping.

He was just cutting across town, mind on errands, when a kid on a scooter slowed to match his pace, eyes wide.

“You’re really big,” the kid said, impressed.

Eric chuckled. “Yeah. Happens.”

The kid hesitated, then blurted, “Can you run fast?”

Eric stopped.

Slowly turned.

“How fast you think?” he asked.

The kid shrugged. “Faster than my bike?”

Eric grinned.

“Hop on.”

The kid froze. “Really?”

Eric crouched slightly, steady as stone. “Hold on tight.”

Ten seconds later, Eric was sprinting down the block — controlled, careful, but unmistakably fast. Wind kicked up. The kid laughed so hard he squeaked.

They didn’t go far. Eric slowed well before the corner, gently letting the kid slide off.

“Whoa,” the kid breathed. “That was AWESOME.”

Eric laughed, hands on his hips. “Told ya.”

From across the street, Ashley had stopped dead, hands on her knees.

“ERIC,” she shouted. “YOU CANNOT JUST—”

Lewis was already filming. “This is going online.”

Jeannie covered her face with one hand. “Lord help me.”

Eric shrugged, unrepentant. “Kid wanted to see.”

Ashley stomped over. “You know *I* said no, right?”

Eric smiled innocently. “They asked different.”

The kid waved enthusiastically and ran back toward the house, clearly planning to tell this story forever.

Ashley pinched the bridge of her nose. “You are *not* helpin’ our reputation.”

Eric laughed. “Worth it.”

And honestly?

It probably was.
