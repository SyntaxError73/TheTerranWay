### **Built for Someone Else**

Earth wasn’t hostile.

That was the frustrating part.

It was just… *inconvenient*.

Everything felt like it had been designed by someone who had never met a sauromorph and never expected to.

Doorways were the first lesson. Too narrow. Too short. Always a calculation. Twist the shoulders. Angle the tail. Mind the hinges. Ashley learned quickly which stores she could enter without knocking something over and which ones required an apology before she even tried.

Chairs were a joke.

Benches were better, but only if they were anchored. Anything lightweight slid the moment a tail shifted. Ashley preferred floors. Eric tolerated stools. Lewis carried a folded cushion like it was a survival tool.

Clothing stores were worse.

Upper-body fits, lower-body *fantasy*. Nothing accounted for feathers, tails, balance, or digitigrade posture. Shoes were an ongoing tragedy — made for feet that pointed the wrong way, flexed the wrong places, and assumed ankles existed where they very much did not.

Driving was another thing entirely.

Pedals assumed legs. Seats assumed hips. Mirrors assumed a neck that sat in a certain place. Ashley loved cars — engines, frames, the *idea* of them — but actually learning to drive felt like forcing herself into a shape she didn’t have.

She ran instead.

Stairs were negotiable. Escalators were not. Elevators were crowded and always just a little too small. Railings were placed for hands that weren’t also managing talons.

People tried to help.

Sometimes too much.

Sometimes not at all.

Cashiers hesitated. Strangers asked questions that started polite and ended invasive. Kids stared openly. Adults pretended not to.

The hardest part wasn’t the looks.

It was the assumptions.

That they needed explaining.
That they were fragile or dangerous.
That they were temporary.

Bathrooms were the most exhausting conversation of all.

Lewis hated that one.

And yet — they adapted.

They learned which grocery stores had wider aisles. Which parks had paths that didn’t suddenly turn into stairs. Which towns looked at them twice and then moved on.

They learned how to exist without asking permission.

Ashley leaned on counters instead of chairs.
Eric positioned himself instinctively to avoid blocking walkways.
Lewis memorized floor plans like maps.
Jeannie carried herself with quiet authority that discouraged nonsense.
John talked to everyone like he belonged — because he did.

Earth wasn’t cruel.

It was just built for humans.

And being a sauromorph here meant constantly translating your body into a language the world didn’t quite speak.

Still, they made it work.

Because inconvenience wasn’t the same as exclusion.

And every day they stayed — every errand run, every adaptation made — they carved out a little more space that said:

*We’re here. This is normal now.*

Even if the world needed time to catch up.
