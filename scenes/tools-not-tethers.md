### **Tools, Not Tethers**

The PC wasn’t supposed to be *hers*.

It was meant to sit in the corner, humming quietly, a bridge between her and Lewis — a way to play games together without leaning over his shoulder or borrowing time. Ashley picked the case because it “looked sturdy,” and Lewis built it because he couldn’t *not* optimize things.

“Just for games,” she said.

Lewis gave her a look. “Sure.”

---

It started innocently.

She wanted to tweak her microphone settings so she didn’t sound “weird” in voice chat. That led to poking around the audio software. Which led to clicking buttons. Which led to making noises.

Ashley discovered very quickly that she liked *sound*.

Not just singing — shaping it. Stretching it. Layering her voice until it echoed in ways she’d never heard before. She learned shortcuts without trying. Figured out workflows by instinct. Built entire soundscapes by accident.

Lewis wandered in one evening, listened for a moment, then stopped dead.

“…When did you learn how to do that.”

Ashley shrugged. “Today?”

She was already ahead of him by the end of the week.

Then came 3D modeling.

Lewis showed her the basics once. Just once.

Ashley treated it like carving — pushing shapes until they felt right. She didn’t fuss over perfection. She explored. She broke things and rebuilt them faster than Lewis could explain what went wrong.

Within a month, she was sculpting environments she’d never seen but somehow recognized. Forests that felt *alive*. Creatures that looked like they could breathe.

Lewis watched in quiet disbelief.

“You’re better than me,” he said one night, not bitter — just honest.

Ashley glanced up. “Am I?”

“Yes.”

She considered that.

Then saved her work and shut the program down.

---

She didn’t quit suddenly.

She just… stopped chasing it.

The PC stayed where it was. Still useful. Still appreciated. But Ashley found herself outside more often than not — singing where her voice didn’t need filters, walking where textures were real, listening to sounds that didn’t loop.

She liked *making* things.

But she loved *being* somewhere.

One afternoon, Eric leaned over her shoulder while she queued up a co-op game.

“You ever think about doin’ more with all that computer stuff?” he asked.

Ashley smiled faintly. “Nah.”

She adjusted her headset. “It’s fun. But it ain’t me.”

Lewis overheard from the other room. “You could’ve been unstoppable.”

Ashley laughed. “I already am.”

---

She kept the PC.

For games with Eric.
For chats with friends she’d never meet but trusted anyway.
For the occasional late-night curiosity spiral.

But when the sun was up and the woods were calling, Ashley shut the screen down without regret.

Some tools were meant to build worlds.

Others were just there to help you share them.

And Ashley knew the difference.
