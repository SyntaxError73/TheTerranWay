### **Seed Packets**

Ashley saved the seeds like they were stories.

Every year, when the plants had finished their cycle and the garden began to quiet down, she carefully collected them — drying, sorting, labeling with simple handwritten notes. Nothing fancy. Just enough to remember where they came from.

She folded the packets herself.

Plain paper. A bit of tape. Sometimes a little doodle in the corner if she was feeling playful.

Lewis once asked her why she didn’t print labels.

“These are nicer,” she said, shrugging. “They look like somebody cared.”

She handed them out casually.

At the farmers market.
To neighbors who stopped to ask about the flowers.
To kids who crouched too close to the garden fence, curious.

“Here,” she’d say. “Try these.”

People would blink. “How much?”

Ashley would hesitate. “Uh… if you wanna give somethin’, sure. But you don’t gotta.”

Most people did anyway. A few dollars. Some produce. Once, a loaf of bread that was still warm.

She accepted it all with the same easy smile.

The best part wasn’t the money.

It was hearing about them later.

“Mine came up purple,” someone told her, amazed.
“These survived the frost,” said another.
“My kid named theirs,” a parent laughed.

Ashley listened like every story mattered — because to her, it did.

Eric helped her organize the packets in a little wooden box he’d made just for them. Solid. Simple.

“You could sell these properly,” he said once.

Ashley shook her head. “Nah. That’d make it a thing.”

Lewis nodded. “You’d hate that.”

She grinned. “Yep.”

At the end of the season, when the garden rested, Ashley would sit on the porch with the box beside her, counting what was left.

Not inventory.

Just memories.

Seeds that had started as curiosity — *what’ll happen if I try this?* — now scattered into other people’s lives.

She didn’t need to see what grew next.

Just knowing it might was enough.

And somewhere around town, little patches of unexpected color bloomed — quiet proof that Ashley had been there, asked a question, and decided to share the answer.
