### **Why Frog Legs**

Amelia didn’t tell anyone at first.

She just… kept choosing them.

Whenever she had the option. Whenever they were available. Frog legs, prepared carefully, always the same way. Familiar. Comforting.

Ashley noticed eventually.

“You really like those, huh?” she said, watching Amelia clean her plate.

Amelia paused, fork hovering. “…Yes.”

“Any reason?”

Amelia hesitated. Then adjusted her glasses — a sure sign she was about to explain something she’d thought about a *lot*.

“Eastern hognose snakes,” she said. “They primarily eat frogs.”

Ashley blinked. “Oh.”

Amelia nodded. “I didn’t realize how much that mattered until I tried them.”

She thought for a moment, searching for the right words. “It’s not hunger. It’s… alignment.”

Lewis perked up immediately. “Ancestral dietary preference.”

“Yes,” Amelia said, relieved. “Exactly.”

Primal listened quietly. After a moment, he said, “Your body remembers.”

Amelia smiled at that.

Frog legs didn’t make her feel heavy. Didn’t make her jittery or dull. They settled something low and instinctual — not a craving, but a quiet *rightness*.

She never ate them carelessly.

She treated them with respect.

Ashley grinned. “Well. Guess that makes sense.”

Amelia looked down at her plate, a little embarrassed. “I hope it’s not strange.”

Ashley shook her head immediately. “Nah. Just… you.”

And that was the thing.

It wasn’t about being unusual.
It wasn’t about novelty or shock.

It was about Amelia listening — not just to research, not just to culture, but to something older, simpler, and deeply her own.

Sometimes, the body knows long before the mind finds the explanation.

And when Amelia eats frog legs, she feels at home in herself.

Which is reason enough.
