### **Absolutely Not**

Ashley knew better than to reach into the craft drawer.

She did it anyway.

The moment her fingers brushed a cotton ball, she recoiled like she’d been shocked, jerking her hand back and shaking it out.

“Nope. Nope nope nope.”

Lewis looked up. “You touched the forbidden cloud, didn’t you.”

“Why does it feel like regret,” she muttered, wiping her hand on her jeans like that might undo it.

She tried again — this time grabbing what she *thought* was denim — only to freeze halfway through the motion.

“…Is this felt.”

“Yes,” Lewis said cheerfully.

She dropped it immediately. “Who *likes* this stuff.”

“People who aren’t you.”

“And therefore wrong.”

Later, Eric was in the garage, sanding down a board.

Ashley made it three seconds into the sound before her shoulders went rigid.

Her feathers puffed involuntarily. “Nope. That sound is illegal.”

Eric stopped at once. “Sorry.”

“It’s soft but it’s *rough*,” she said, grimacing. “My ears don’t know what to do with that.”

Lewis nodded solemnly. “Cardboard ripping is also a crime.”

“YES.”

Dinner didn’t go much better.

Ashley stared at her plate like it had personally betrayed her.

“Why are the grits lookin’ at me like that,” she asked.

Jeannie smiled gently. “You don’t have to eat ‘em.”

“Good,” Ashley said, sliding the bowl away. “They feel like sand that gave up on life.”

She reached for something safer — then froze again.

“…Is there coconut in this.”

“Yes,” Jeannie admitted.

Ashley pushed it away too. “That texture is *lying*.”

John snorted. “Tomatoes are still worse.”

Ashley pointed at him emphatically. “Of Hell.”

“Of Hell,” he agreed.

None of it embarrassed her anymore.

She’d learned what her body hated and listened to it. No forcing. No pretending. No apologies.

Ashley avoided what felt wrong, shielded herself from sounds that made her skin crawl, and built a world where comfort mattered.

And when someone asked why?

She just shrugged.

“My brain says no,” she’d say. “And I trust it.”

Which, honestly, was one of the smartest things about her.
