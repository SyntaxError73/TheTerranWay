### **Baby Bird**

Ashley Hunter was halfway between classes when she detoured, like she always did.

She liked to check on Newt.

Lewis—*Newt*, now, because he’d somehow made it a point of pride to keep live animals in his shirt pocket—had just been moved up from kindergarten into first grade. The big city school still hadn’t quite figured him out. He was a year younger than most of the kids in his class, but already ahead of the curve in ways that made teachers tired and classmates confused.

Ashley figured keeping an eye on him was just good sense.

That’s when she saw her.

A small lamia girl stood frozen in the hallway, coiled tight and wrapped around her teacher’s leg like it was the only thing keeping her upright. Her glasses were a little crooked. A pearl necklace rested neatly against her collar. She wore a green shirt with a pink cartoon bird printed on the front.

The kid looked *terrified*.

Ashley slowed immediately.

Other students passed by without a second glance. Ashley didn’t.

She crouched down, careful not to startle her. “Hey there,” she said gently, accent thick and unpolished. “That’s a real cute shirt you got.”

The lamia flinched—but then peeked out just a little.

“…It’s Baby Bird,” she said, voice small but earnest.

Ashley smiled. “Baby Bird?”

The girl nodded. “He’s my favorite.”

Ashley tilted her head. “What’s he about?”

Something sparked.

“He lives in the bad part’a the city,” the lamia said, suddenly animated, words tumbling out. “But he’s real nice, an’ his godmother takes care’a him, and he don’t got feathers so he gets cold sometimes—but it’s okay ‘cause he’s loved anyway.”

Ashley didn’t know the show.

But she understood *that*.

“Well,” she said softly, “that sounds like a mighty good bird.”

The lamia smiled—really smiled.

“I’m Amelia.”

Ashley held out her hand. “I’m Ashley. That’s my little brother Newt. He’s in your class.”

Newt waved enthusiastically, a small newt’s head peeking out of his shirt pocket like it was waving too.

Ashley looked back at Amelia, her expression serious now.
“Ain’t nobody gonna mess with you while I’m around,” she said firmly. “I promise.”

Amelia’s eyes widened.

“Forever?” she asked.

Ashley nodded. “Forever.”

Amelia lit up. “Then we can be like Baby Bird an’ Hide-and-Seek Bubblegum!”

Ashley laughed. “Yeah. We can do that.”

She didn’t know who Hide-and-Seek Bubblegum was.

But she meant it anyway.

---

Friendship followed naturally.

Through Newt, mostly.

Amelia came over for playdates, still shy but curious. Newt showed her how to draw, patient and proud, and Amelia clung to it like she’d been waiting her whole life for permission to love art. Ashley watched cartoons with her once the Hunters finally got a TV, learning Baby Bird right alongside her.

They ran around the farm. Played games in the fields. Eric showed off football moves and nearly knocked himself over every time. Amelia laughed until her sides hurt.

Ashley protected her without thinking.

Years passed.

Grades changed. Voices deepened. Worlds grew larger.

But the promise stayed.

Now Amelia was twenty-eight. Ashley was thirty-two. The accent had softened, the shyness hadn’t vanished, and the bond had never once loosened.

Still Baby Bird.
Still Hide-and-Seek Bubblegum.

Still best friends.

Forever had always meant something to them.

And it still did. 💚
