### **Only Hatchling**

Amelia grew up in a very quiet house.

Not the good kind of quiet.
The kind that felt scheduled.

Her parents were always *busy*. Meetings. Calls. Deadlines. Projects that lived in neat folders and mattered more than the small lamia coiled on the couch with her coloring book.

They weren’t cruel.

They just… weren’t *there*.

Mornings passed with polite nods over coffee. Evenings ended with doors closing and voices fading behind walls. Amelia learned early how to entertain herself without being in the way.

Her parents remembered one thing faithfully.

Her hatch day.

Once a year, the house changed. Balloons appeared. A cake was ordered—always the right flavor. Gifts were wrapped with care. Photos were taken. Smiles were practiced.

“You’re growing so fast,” her mother would say.

“Yes,” her father agreed. “We’re very proud of you.”

Amelia smiled back. She always did.

And the next day, everything went back where it belonged.

Silence. Schedules. Space.

She learned not to ask for much. Learned to coil neatly. Learned to love quietly. Learned that being *low maintenance* meant being safe.

The first time Amelia stayed over at the Hunters’ farm, she didn’t understand what she was feeling.

It was loud. Not chaotic—just *full*. Footsteps. Laughter. Someone always passing through the room. Doors opening and closing without ceremony.

Nobody asked why she was there.

They just made room.

Jeannie handed her a plate without comment. John talked like she’d always been part of the conversation. Eric nodded at her like she belonged. Newt dragged her into whatever he was doing without hesitation.

And Ashley—

Ashley checked on her.

Not once. Not twice. Constantly.

“You good?”
“You hungry?”
“You wanna do this or that?”

Always an option. Never a demand.

Amelia didn’t realize she was holding her breath until she finally let it out.

Later, lying on a blanket in the living room while the house hummed around her, Amelia stared up at the ceiling and thought, *Oh.*

This is what people mean when they say *family*.

Not birthdays.

Not gifts.

But being noticed when you don’t ask to be.

As she got older, the difference only grew clearer.

Her parents sent messages. Cards. Money. They asked how school was going in the way people ask about the weather.

The Hunters asked how she *felt*.

So when Amelia was tired, she went to Ashley’s family.

When she was scared, she went to Ashley’s family.

When she needed somewhere to exist without performing, she went to Ashley’s family.

They didn’t celebrate her just once a year.

They celebrated her *being there*.

And that was why, even as an adult, even after crossing worlds, Amelia curled closer to them without thinking.

Not because she hated where she came from.

But because she finally knew what it felt like to be wanted on ordinary days.

And once you learn that?

You never forget it.
