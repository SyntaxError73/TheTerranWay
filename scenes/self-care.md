### **Self-Care**

Lewis doesn’t *avoid* self-care.

He just… forgets it exists.

Days slide by on rails of projects and thoughts and half-finished ideas, and somewhere in between those rails are things like eating regular meals, drinking water, showering, brushing his teeth. None of them are urgent. None of them scream.

So they vanish.

He’ll be three tabs deep into some obscure forum thread, brain fully occupied, when Ashley pokes her head into his room and squints at him.

“…When’s the last time you ate?”

Lewis blinks. “Uh.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“…Yesterday?”

She raises an eyebrow.

“…Okay, maybe *technically* yesterday.”

She sighs, not angry. Just resigned. “C’mon. Food. Now.”

Lewis follows because it’s easier than arguing—and because somewhere deep down, he knows he needs external reminders to stay tethered to his own body. He doesn’t love that about himself, but he’s grateful for it.

He’s not careless.

He’s just… unanchored unless someone pulls the thread taut again.

Ashley’s struggles are different.

They’re *sensory*.

Brushing her teeth feels like a personal attack. The vibration. The foam. The way it demands attention in her mouth when she already has too many sensations queued up.

She stands at the sink sometimes, toothbrush in hand, glaring at her reflection like she’s negotiating with an enemy.

“…Why can’t y’all just replace yourselves,” she mutters at her teeth. “Like a shark. Or a crocodile. Or literally anything sensible.”

She does brush. Eventually. Because she has to.

But she hates every second of it.

Her hair is another battle she refuses to fight more than necessary.

Messy ponytail. Every day. High and loose, pulled back just enough to keep it out of her face and off her neck. Brushing takes too long. Hurts too much. Feels pointless when it’s just going to tangle again the moment she steps outside.

People sometimes assume it’s a style choice.

Ashley knows better.

It’s a **survival choice**.

What makes it work—what keeps it from becoming neglect—is the *ecosystem* they live in.

Ashley reminds Lewis to eat.
Lewis reminds Ashley to hydrate.
Jeannie notices when either of them is running on fumes.
John turns self-care into jokes so it doesn’t feel like a moral failure.
Eric fixes things quietly so no one has to ask.
Primal notices shifts before words ever happen.

No one is perfect at caring for themselves.

They’re just good at caring *around* each other.

Ashley still wishes her teeth would regenerate forever.
Lewis still forgets basic needs when his brain goes elsewhere.

But between reminders, shortcuts, messy ponytails, and gentle nudges—

They’re okay.

Not because they’ve conquered these things.

But because they’ve stopped pretending they should have to do it alone.
