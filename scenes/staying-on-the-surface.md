### **Staying on the Surface**

Ashley floated without trying.

Her feathers spread the water the way leaves did after rain, her body resting high and light, barely breaking the surface. Sun glinted off the slow ripples around her as she paddled lazily, legs kicking in an easy rhythm she’d known since she was little.

She loved this part.

The quiet.
The cool against her skin.
The way the lake held her up like it understood her.

She never went under.

Not once.

People assumed it was fear of dying.

It wasn’t.

Ashley had thought about drowning enough to know the truth of it — not the end, but the *before*. The panic. The burning pressure in her chest as carbon dioxide built up, screaming at her lungs long before oxygen ever ran out.

That was the part she feared.

That was the part she respected.

So she stayed prepared.

She’d learned early that her waterproof feathers were a gift, not a guarantee. They worked because of the oils her body produced — oils she protected carefully.

Diving would strip them away.

A full soak meant heavier feathers, less buoyancy, more drag. More chances for something unseen below the surface to catch on her — a fishing hook, a line, a piece of debris — the kinds of quiet hazards that didn’t care how strong you were.

Ashley thought about that every time she swam.

Not obsessively.

Practically.

She drifted closer to shore, where the water shallowed and the bottom was visible. Clear. Safe.

Eric sat nearby with his feet in the water, watching.

“You ever gonna dive?” he asked casually.

Ashley shook her head. “Nope.”

“You’re a good swimmer.”

“I know,” she replied easily. “That’s why I don’t.”

Eric smiled at that.

Later, back home, Ashley took a long shower.

Hot water. Steam. The familiar scent of soap.

It wasn’t just about being clean.

Her body responded the way it always did — replenishing the oils that made her feathers slick and buoyant, restoring what the water took away. She’d learned that too, through experience and attention.

Care wasn’t paranoia.

It was maintenance.

---

Ashley loved the water.

She just loved the surface more.

Because staying afloat wasn’t about bravery — it was about knowing your body, knowing your limits, and choosing to respect both.

And that was how she stayed alive.

Every time.
