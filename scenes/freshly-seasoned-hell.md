### Freshly Seasoned Hell

John didn’t even pause the game.

On-screen text flashed: Susan Hale has joined your party.

John squinted at it for half a second.

“Well,” he said thoughtfully, “look at that.”

Ashley leaned forward. “What?”

John nodded at the screen. “Freshly Seasoned Hell.”

Ashley stared. “…Dad.”

Lewis, from the hallway: “I hate that my brain immediately accepted that.”

Amelia adjusted her glasses. “That’s not even phonetically correct.”

John shrugged, completely unbothered. “Close enough.”

Primal tilted his head. “Is she… dangerous?”

“Oh, absolutely,” John said. “You don’t get a name like that without earnin’ it.”

Ashley laughed so hard she had to cover her face. “You cannot keep doin’ this.”

John grinned. “Too late. That’s her name now.”

Five minutes later, Ashley caught herself saying, “Wait, where’d Freshly Seasoned Hell go?”

John pointed triumphantly at the screen. “See?”

And just like that, no one in the house ever remembered Susan Hale’s real name again.
