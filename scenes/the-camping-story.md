### **The Camping Story**

The campsite sat in a shallow bowl of trees, just far enough from the road that the world softened into leaves and creek-water. Frozen Head’s ridgeline loomed in the distance, blue-gray and patient, while the afternoon sun filtered down in warm, slanted stripes.

John had gone **all-in**.

Not *tent-and-a-cooler* camping.

No—this was **John Hunter Camping™**.

There was a large family tent, a smaller auxiliary tent, a folding table, a propane stove, a grill *and* a griddle, three lanterns, two battery-powered fans, and—most importantly to exactly one lamia—

A **portable power station**, humming softly under the table.

Amelia hovered near it like a reverent pilgrim.

“Okay,” John said, squatting and pointing with a hotdog skewer. “We got two USBs, one regular outlet, and if you don’t try to power a NASA launch, this thing’ll last all weekend.”

Amelia’s eyes were bright in a way they rarely were outdoors.
“…There’s Wi-Fi too?”

Lewis—Newt—popped up immediately. “Cell booster. Don’t get excited, it’s like—two bars of hope.”

“That’s *plenty*,” Amelia said softly, already setting her phone down with a charger like she was tucking it in. “I just need… existence confirmation.”

Ashley snorted, feathers ruffling as she dragged a cooler across the dirt. “You come out to the woods just to stare at the same rectangle you stare at inside.”

“Yes,” Amelia replied calmly. “But *out here* the rectangle doesn’t judge me.”

Eric laughed quietly, hammering a tent stake with controlled, architectural precision. He didn’t look up, just said, “Let her have it, Ash.”

Ashley grumbled but smiled anyway.

Primal returned from the treeline with an armful of dry branches, heat still radiating faintly from his skin despite the mild air. Just in case. He stacked the wood carefully, then nudged a flat stone into place near Amelia’s setup—close enough to be companionable, not intrusive.

He sat without a word.

That was how Primal showed love.

---

By evening, the camp smelled like smoke and sausage. Fireflies stitched green-gold sparks through the dusk. The creek murmured nearby, steady and reassuring.

Ashley stood ankle-deep in the water, poking at rocks with a stick.

“Y’all hear that?” she asked.

Lewis immediately replied, “The call of the wild? The whisper of destiny?”

“No,” Ashley said flatly. “A frog that sounds judgmental.”

Amelia, wrapped in a blanket near the fire, glanced up from her tablet. “He’s probably just cold.”

“I’m cold,” Ashley said. “You don’t hear *me* yelling.”

Primal tilted his head, listening. “…He is yelling *at* the moon.”

The moon already rising —faint, pale, rotated like the bright side was facing the ground. The memory of Luna Minor distant, but Amelia felt it still, and pulled her blanket tighter, grounding herself by touching the warm power station with her tail.

Charged.
Connected.
Safe.

Jeannie passed out skewers, her hands smelling like marshmallow and cinnamon. “Phones down for ten minutes,” she said gently. “Just ten.”

Amelia hesitated—then unplugged, setting the tablet aside.

“…Okay.”

Ashley noticed. Didn’t comment. Just shifted closer so Amelia could lean against her warm, feathered side.

The fire popped. John told a story that went nowhere. Eric listened like it mattered. Lewis whispered a theory about raccoons having unions. Primal watched the flames, tail giving a slow, contented wag.

Amelia breathed.

The woods didn’t swallow her.
The dark didn’t demand anything.
And when the ten minutes were up—

Her phone was still there.
Still charged.
Still hers.

Camping, it turned out, could have electricity.

And that made all the difference.

---

The campground settled into quiet the way a house does after everyone finally finds a place to sit.

Crickets tuned up. The creek kept its steady, conversational murmur. Above the treeline, one moon hung pale and ordinary and blessedly real—no echoes, no wrongness, just a familiar light filtering through leaves.

The camp itself was… comfortable.

John Hunter had succeeded.

The tents were pitched clean and square. Lanterns glowed warm and low. The portable power station sat under the table, humming softly like a well-behaved appliance instead of a miracle. A small extension cord ran to Amelia’s side of the fire ring.

Amelia lay bundled in a blanket with her tablet charging beside her, phone in hand, sketching quietly. The glow reflected in her eyes. She looked peaceful in the way only guaranteed electricity could provide.

Primal sat nearby, back against a log, his legs stretched out, tail curled loosely at his side. He fed the fire now and then, careful and deliberate, watching sparks rise and vanish. When Amelia shifted, he adjusted the lantern angle so the light wouldn’t strain her eyes.

Ashley noticed.

She didn’t say anything.
She just smiled and pretended not to.

---

Sometime deep in the night—when the fire had settled into coals and even Lewis’s hypothetical raccoons had gone to bed—Ashley stirred in her tent.

She froze.

Bladder.

She lay there, eyes open, weighing her options.

Restroom:
– Far
– Cold
– Involved shoes
– Would wake her up way too much

Tree:
– Close
– Familiar
– Efficient
– Spiritually satisfying

Ashley quietly unzipped the tent and eased herself out, survival pack already strapped around her raptor hips like always. Habit. Comfort. Identity.

She padded barefoot toward the treeline, feathers barely rustling.

“Ash?”

She flinched.

Lewis sat up on his sleeping pad near the fire, hair a mess, hoodie half-zipped, eyes sharp in that just-woke-up-but-already-processing way of his.

“…You stalking something?” he murmured.

Ashley sighed through her nose. “Lewis.”

“That’s not a no.”

She shifted her weight, feathers rustling. “It’s late. Go back to sleep.”

Lewis squinted toward the trees. Then the restroom path. Then back at her.

“Oh.”

She waited for it.
The comment.
The joke.

Instead, he nodded once.

“…Yeah. Okay. That tracks.”

Ashley blinked. “That’s it?”

He shrugged. “Well. It’s **your** campsite.”

She relaxed instantly, tail giving a faint, satisfied flick. “Thank you.”

“No problem,” Lewis said, already lying back down. “Don’t get eaten.”

“I am the thing that eats,” she muttered, but her heart felt lighter as she continued into the trees.

She didn’t notice Eric until she was coming back.

He stood a little ways off, arms folded loosely, gaze lifted toward the sky. He turned when he sensed her, not startled—just aware.

They locked eyes.

Nothing was said.

Eric’s expression was calm, unreadable. Not angry. Not amused. Just… thoughtful. Protective in the way he always was.

Ashley stiffened for half a second, then squared her shoulders, daring him to say something.

He didn’t.

He simply nodded once—small, deliberate—and looked away again, giving her privacy without pretending he hadn’t seen.

Ashley exhaled.

“…Night,” she said quietly.

“Night,” Eric replied, just as softly.

She returned to her tent feeling oddly settled.

No shame.
No scolding.
Just family adjusting around her edges.

Some things didn’t need to be explained.

---

In the next morning, as the moon settled to make way for the rising sun; The first human to notice them did not scream.

She slowed her dog instead.

The woman—mid-forties, ball cap, Tennessee plate—stopped at a respectful distance and pretended very hard to be fascinated by the bulletin board near the restrooms. Her dog, a squat hound mix, stared openly.

John noticed first. He always did.

He didn’t tense. Didn’t posture. Just shifted slightly so his bulk blocked the youngest from view, one hand resting casually on the picnic table.

“Mornin’,” he called, voice warm and unmistakably Southern.

The woman startled, then laughed. “Oh!—hi. Sorry. Didn’t mean to—”

“It’s alright,” Jeannie said gently, stepping into view. “You’re fine.”

The woman’s eyes flicked—quick, curious, not unkind—taking in feathers, tails, posture. Then she relaxed, shoulders lowering.

“You folks camping?”

Lewis, who had been crouched near the firepit arranging sticks just so, looked up. “Nah. We live here now. Just squatting.”

Ashley, who had her eyes fixated on the dog, elbowed her little brother. “Newt.”

He grinned. “Kidding. Yes. Camping.”

The woman smiled, reassured by the normalcy of it all. “Well. Y’all picked a good weekend. Weather’s behaving.”

As she walked on, she glanced back once more—not fearful, just thoughtful.

“Cool family,” she murmured to her dog.

---

Later, a man did react badly.

He froze mid-step on the gravel loop, eyes wide, breath catching sharp in his chest.

“What the—”

Before he could finish, a second human stepped between him and the campsite.

“You’re fine,” said a familiar voice.

It was the older ranger. The one who’d helped John find the right permit. The one who’d brought extra trash bags without being asked.

“They’re good people,” the ranger continued, calm and firm. “Been around. Keep to themselves. Kids are polite.”

“They’re—” the man swallowed. “They’re not—?”

“They’re campers,” the ranger said flatly. “Same as you.”

The man hesitated. Looked again.

Ashley stood near the firepit, colorful bandaids visible on her arm as she laughed too loudly at something Lewis said. Amelia sat under the awning with her tablet plugged in, tail neatly tucked, eyes focused and utterly uninterested in the outside world. Primal stacked wood with methodical care, glancing up just long enough to clock tension before relaxing again.

Normal.

The man exhaled. “Huh.”

And kept walking.

---

A group of teenagers passed later.

Phones came out.

So did voices—from other humans.

“Hey,” said a woman from the next site over. “Don’t.”

“They’re not a zoo,” added another. “Leave ’em be.”

The teens hesitated. Lowered their phones. One waved awkwardly.

Lewis waved back enthusiastically.

Ashley gave a nod that read acknowledged.

Eric watched it all from the edge of the clearing, arms resting loosely at his sides.

People noticed him. They always did.

His size helped.
His stillness helped more.

No one crossed a line.

Amelia barely looked up from her drawing, though she felt the eyes sometimes. When she did, she grounded herself with the hum of the power station and the certainty of full battery bars.

Primal noticed every shift. Every pause. Every raised voice.

He didn’t bare teeth.
Didn’t growl.

He simply stayed close.

By afternoon, the Hunters were just… part of the campground.

The dinosaur-centaur family by the creek.
The lamia with the charger.
The quiet shifter who stacked wood like it mattered.

People adjusted.

People protected.

And when the sun dipped low again, a human from two sites over brought over extra firewood without saying a word—just set it down, nodded once, and walked away.

John watched him go, smiling softly.

“See?” he said. “Told you. Good people.”

Ashley leaned back against the table, tail swaying contentedly.

“Yeah,” she said. “They are.”

---

By late afternoon, the campground had settled into a comfortable rhythm.

The kind where nothing urgent was happening, and that was the point.

Ashley sat on the edge of the picnic table, survival pack still strapped around her hips, carefully replacing the flint and steel she’d taken out earlier. One of her bandaids had peeled halfway off, the unicorn now missing a corner.

She didn’t notice.

Lewis crouched nearby, poking at the firepit with a stick like it had personally wronged him. “If we build it up just right, we can get a really clean burn tonight.”

“You say that every time,” Ashley said. “And every time I end up on fire.”

“Statistically, that’s not my fault.”

“Newt.”

He grinned.

Primal brought over another armful of wood—human-cut this time, split and stacked neatly by someone else. He set it down, then nudged a chunk closer to the pit with his foot, testing weight and dryness before adding it to the pile.

Ashley watched him for a moment.

“…You like it here?” she asked.

Primal nodded once. “…Quiet. Smells right.”

She huffed a soft laugh. “Yeah.”

Amelia had relocated slightly—still under the awning, still plugged in—but now sitting sideways on the bench with her tail coiled neatly, sketching something that looked suspiciously like the campsite itself. The tents were simplified. The trees exaggerated. The firepit carefully centered.

She paused when a shadow fell across her screen.

A young human—maybe ten or eleven—stood a respectful distance away, hands jammed in their pockets.

“…Are you drawing?” they asked.

Amelia nodded. “Yes.”

“…You’re really good.”

Amelia blinked. Compliments always landed oddly, like she had to decide where to put them. “…Thank you.”

The kid lingered another second, then smiled and ran back to their family without asking anything else.

Amelia watched them go, then returned to her drawing, cheeks warm.

She texted Ashley without looking up:

Amelia: A human child complimented my art. I survived.
Ashley: Proud of you.

Amelia smiled.

Eric came back as the sun dipped lower, expression peaceful in that grounded way he got after being alone. He said little—just took over stirring the coals, adjusting the grate, making sure the fire stayed safe and contained.

John and Jeannie sat side by side at the table, feet brushing occasionally.

“You ever think about how weird this all is?” Jeannie asked softly.

John glanced around—the family, the fire, the quiet acceptance of nearby humans. “Yeah.”

She leaned her head against his shoulder. “And how it still feels… right?”

He smiled. “Especially that.”

As evening settled in again, dinner was simple and shared. Plates passed. Jokes recycled. Someone stole someone else’s fork.

Ashley stood too fast at one point, clipped her arm on the table edge, and hissed through her teeth.

Eric was there immediately, steady hand on her elbow. “You good?”

“Yeah. Yeah. I just—” She peeled the old bandaid off and replaced it with a new one. This one had cartoon sharks. “There. Fixed.”

Lewis squinted. “You know they make adult bandaids.”

“These are adult bandaids,” Ashley said. “They’re emotionally supportive.”

Primal made a soft, approving sound.

Night came gently this time.

The moon rose. Just one. Familiar. No pressure. No memories tugging too hard.

People from nearby campsites drifted past, nodded, waved. One asked about fishing. Another complimented the fire. No one stared for too long.

The Hunters were just… there.

Ashley leaned back on her hands, watching sparks rise, feeling the ground under her claws. This place wasn’t hers the way Silver Hollow had been—but it was close enough for now.

She glanced at Amelia, glowing faintly blue from her screen, safe and charged.

At Primal, steady and watchful.

At her family, loud and quiet in all the right ways.

“…Hey,” she said softly.

They looked at her.

“This is good.”

No one argued.

---

The fire had settled into that sweet spot—steady, crackling, throwing light just far enough to make faces glow and shadows dance.

Ashley sat cross-legged near the pit, poking at a stick with the intensity of someone absolutely not paying attention.

John cleared his throat.

That alone was a warning sign.

“So,” he said casually, “since we’re all sittin’ here and nobody’s tellin’ ghost stories yet, I figure I’ll tell y’all why Ashley has one of her nicknames.”

Ashley froze.

“…Dad.”

Jeannie’s lips twitched. “Oh. That one?”

Lewis perked up immediately. “There’s lore??”

“No,” Ashley said firmly. “There is not.”

John ignored her completely. “Ashley here was about—what—six?”

“Seven,” Jeannie corrected.

“Seven,” John nodded. “And we were campin’. Not unlike this. State park. Real nice. Real muddy.”

Ashley groaned and dragged her hands over her face. “Please stop.”

“She had just learned how to fish,” John continued. “Was very proud of herself. Caught a little catfish all on her own.”

Eric smiled faintly. He remembered.

“She decides she’s gonna clean it herself. Says, ‘I got it, Dad. I watched you.’”

Ashley muttered, “I did watch.”

John grinned. “She did. Problem was, she watched the result, not the process.”

Lewis was already cackling.

“So she guts this fish. Sloppy. Real enthusiastic. Gets guts everywhere.”

“I was learning,” Ashley protested weakly.

“And then,” John said, pausing for effect, “instead of washin’ her hands like a normal child—”

Ashley slowly lowered herself onto the ground. “Oh my God.”

“—she wipes them on her feathers.”

Dead silence.

Then Lewis howled.

“Oh NO.”

Jeannie covered her mouth, shoulders shaking. Even Eric looked down, smiling despite himself.

“And then,” John continued, delighted now, “she comes over to hug her mother.”

Ashley made a strangled noise.

Jeannie laughed openly. “She smelled like low tide.”

“I thought it was seasoning!” Ashley cried. “I was SEVEN.”

John wiped his eyes. “Took three baths to get the smell out. And for the rest of that trip…”

He leaned back, satisfied.

“We called her ‘Guts.’”

The fire popped.

Lewis collapsed sideways. “GUTS. Oh my God.”

Primal tilted his head. “…That is… efficient.”

Ashley peeked up through her fingers, mortified. “You promised you’d stop telling people that.”

John shrugged. “I promised I wouldn’t tell strangers.”

She looked around the fire—family, Primal, Amelia—

Amelia, who had gone very still.

“…Guts,” Amelia repeated softly, testing it.

Ashley pointed at her. “You don’t get to use it.”

Amelia smiled just a little. “I absolutely do.”

Ashley groaned and flopped back onto the ground, tail thumping once in defeat.

Eric leaned over slightly, voice low. “You were brave.”

She glanced at him. “…Thanks.”

Primal scooted closer, offering her a marshmallow on a stick without comment.

Ashley took it, resigned.

“…I hate all of you.”

John beamed. “Love you too, Guts.”

The fire crackled on, fed by old stories and the kind of embarrassment that only comes from being deeply, unmistakably loved.

---

The fire had burned lower by the time it came back around.

Most of the laughter had settled. The kind that leaves the air warm instead of loud.

Ashley sat cross-legged again, chewing thoughtfully on a piece of chocolate that had survived the s’mores rush. The nickname still hung there, half-joke, half-memory.

“Y’know,” she said eventually, voice quieter than usual.

John looked over. “Uh-oh.”

Ashley flicked a pebble into the fire. It popped once.

“I don’t actually hate ‘Guts.’”

Lewis blinked. “Wait. Really?”

She shrugged, feathers lifting. “I did. For a long time.”

Eric watched her, saying nothing.

Ashley rubbed at the edge of her survival pack, thumb brushing the familiar fabric. “But… it kinda fits. Just not for the reason y’all think.”

Jeannie tilted her head. “How so, sweetheart?”

Ashley hesitated, then said it anyway. “I got a good gut instinct. Always have. Even when I don’t know why something feels wrong—or right.”

Primal’s ears lifted slightly.

“And,” she added, squaring her shoulders just a bit, “I got the guts to do stuff. Be loud. Be first. Be wrong sometimes.”

Lewis smiled. “That’s… actually kind of metal.”

John chuckled softly, not teasing this time. “Yeah. It is.”

Eric nodded once, approval clear without needing words.

Amelia glanced up from her screen. “…I like that meaning better.”

Ashley grinned, genuine this time. “Yeah. Me too.”

The nickname shifted, just a little—no longer just a story about fish guts and bad decisions, but something steadier.

Something earned.

Primal reached over and tapped her knee lightly, grounding, approving.

“…Guts,” he said quietly.

Ashley huffed a laugh. “Yeah?”

“…Fits.”

She leaned back, firelight warm on her feathers, feeling settled in her skin.

Some names stuck because they embarrassed you.

The good ones stayed because you grew into them.

---

Home settled back around them the way it always did.

Same porch. Same trees. Same stretch of land that smelled like damp leaves and soil and something that wanted to grow whether it was invited or not.

Ashley unpacked on autopilot, survival pack still clipped around her hips out of habit. The garden sat just beyond the fence line—neatly planned, lovingly tended, and absolutely ravaged by deer every single year.

She stood there for a long moment, staring at it.

Then she thought about the campground.

About Lewis’s acceptance.
Eric’s quiet, nonjudgmental nod.
Nobody hounding her. Nobody making it weird.

And about how well it had worked.

“…Huh,” she murmured.

The idea came together fast.

Ashley waited until late afternoon, when the sun dipped low and the deer usually started getting bold. She walked the perimeter of the garden, tail swaying thoughtfully, senses alert.

No ceremony.
No shame.
Just instinct.

She stood there and marked the garden strategically, deliberately, like she was planting a flag only she could see... and only the animals could smell.

It felt… grounding.

When she finished, she stepped back, hands on her hips, feathers settling.

“…If this works,” she muttered, “I’m a genius.”

It worked.

That night, she watched from the porch as two deer approached the fence line, paused—

And turned around.

Ashley’s eyes went wide.

“…NO WAY.”

She slapped a hand over her mouth, vibrating with excitement. “IT WORKED.”

She immediately texted Lewis.

Ashley: DEER TURNED AROUND.
Lewis: You threatened them spiritually, didn’t you.
Ashley: SCIENCE.

Amelia, curled up nearby with her tablet plugged in, glanced up. “…Why are you whisper-shouting?”

Ashley grinned, feral and proud. “I solved the deer problem.”

“…How.”

Ashley hesitated.

“…Biologically.”

Amelia stared at her for three full seconds. Then nodded. “…Valid.”

The only problem left was Mom and Dad.

Ashley spent the rest of the evening in a low-grade state of anticipatory dread. She jumped every time Jeannie stepped outside. She flinched when John leaned on the porch railing.

Nobody said anything.

The next morning, John stood at the garden fence, coffee in hand, squinting.

“Huh,” he said.

Ashley froze halfway through reaching for a tool. “…Huh?”

John took a sip. “Deer didn’t touch it.”

Jeannie joined him, arms folded thoughtfully. “That’s new.”

Ashley’s heart hammered.

“…Yeah,” she said, too quickly. “Weird.”

John glanced at her. Then at the fence. Then back at her.

A long pause.

“…Did you do somethin’?”

Ashley braced herself.

“…Maybe.”

Jeannie raised an eyebrow. “Ashley.”

Ashley exhaled, shoulders slumping. “I didn’t hurt anything. I just—marked.”

Silence.

Ashley stared at the ground, waiting for judgment. For teasing. For please don’t do that.

Instead—

John snorted.

“You mean like how folks buy coyote pee in jugs?”

Ashley looked up, stunned. “…Yes?”

Jeannie sighed, rubbing her temple. “Well. It is natural.”

Ashley blinked. “…I’m not in trouble?”

Jeannie met her eyes. “Did you damage the garden?”

“No.”

“Did you scare the neighbors?”

“…No.”

“Did it work?”

Ashley nodded, barely containing her grin.

Jeannie gave a small, resigned smile. “Then I suppose I can live with it.”

John grinned. “Guts strikes again.”

Ashley laughed, relief flooding her whole body. “I’m not weird?”

John clapped her on the shoulder. “Sweetheart. You’re ours.”

She stood there a moment longer, feeling something click into place.

Camping had given her space.
Home had given her permission.

And the garden—

The garden was safe.
