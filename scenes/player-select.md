### **Player Select**

It started with good intentions.

Ashley dragged an extra folding table into the living room. Controllers were charged. Consoles stacked. Snacks everywhere. Someone—Lewis—had already optimized the Wi-Fi “just in case.”

“This is gonna be great,” Ashley announced. “Family game night.”

Jeannie raised an eyebrow from her chair. “Last time y’all said that, Eric unplugged the router.”

“That was one time,” Eric muttered. “And it *was* lagging.”

John cracked his knuckles and sat down with a controller like it was an old friend. “Alright. What’re we playin’? Long as it’s got quests and inventory management, I’m happy.”

Lewis grinned. “Hear me out—eight-player sci-fi MMO trial. I’ve already made everyone characters.”

“No,” Eric said instantly.

Amelia curled up on the couch with a blanket and her handheld console. “I brought my own game. It has farming. And no timers.”

Primal leaned over her shoulder. “Are there creatures?”

“Small ones. Friendly.”

Primal nodded politely. “…I will try.”

### **Round One: The Compromise (It Fails)**

They attempted a **survival crafting game** first.

Eric and Ashley were immediately in sync.

“I’ll gather wood—”
“I’ll build the shelter—”
“Watch for weather—”
“Already am.”

Within minutes, they had a functioning base.

John, meanwhile, was wandering into the distance. “There’s a ruin over here. Feels important.”

Lewis had somehow opened a tech tree and was already three menus deep. “If we optimize energy production—”

Jeannie gently cleaned a virtual floor. “This is relaxing.”

Amelia had fallen into a lake and was trying to figure out how to climb out without stress.

Primal stared at a massive hostile creature in the distance. “…Can we fight that?”

Eric shouted, “NO, WE ARE NOT READY.”

Primal looked genuinely disappointed.

### **Round Two: The RPG Era**

John insisted on an older open-world RPG.

“I played this when I was your age,” he said proudly. “This map ain’t got no quest markers. You gotta *listen*.”

Ashley squinted. “Why is everything brown.”

Lewis sighed. “The UI is… archaic.”

Primal, however, was enthralled.

“There is lore,” he said reverently. “And consequences.”

Amelia watched quietly, then whispered, “This NPC reminds me of someone.”

John beamed. “See? It’s got soul.”

Eric accidentally aggroed half a village.

### **Round Three: Cozy Truce**

Eventually, the chaos settled into **parallel play**.

* Amelia played a cozy farming game, occasionally handing the controller to Primal to help with puzzles.
* Primal, later, booted up a JRPG boss fight and *everyone* stopped to watch.
* Ashley and Eric co-oped a survival world on a second screen, bickering happily.
* Lewis ran an MMO on his laptop, narrating his achievements to anyone who would listen.
* Jeannie cleaned a virtual car and sipped tea, perfectly content.
* John wandered between screens, offering unsolicited advice.

“Back in my day—”
“Dad.”
“—we didn’t have autosave.”

### **The Real Game**

No one finished anything.

No one agreed on a favorite.

But at some point, Ashley laughed so hard she snorted. Eric threatened to unplug something *again*. Amelia leaned against Primal, sleepy but happy. Lewis infodumped. John reminisced. Jeannie watched them all like this was exactly what she’d hoped for.

Primal looked around the room—screens glowing, voices overlapping, warmth everywhere—and said quietly:

“I don’t think the point was winning.”

Ashley grinned. “Yeah. That tracks.”

And just like that, family game night worked.

Not because they played the same game.

But because they played **together**.
