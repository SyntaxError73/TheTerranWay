### **The Line She Doesn’t Cross Lightly**

Ashley can still go feral.

That part of her never disappeared — it just got locked behind layers of restraint, awareness, and hard-earned self-control.

When she’s pushed far enough, her body knows *exactly* what to do long before her thoughts catch up.

Her heart rate spikes.
Her hearing narrows.
Her feathers slick tight instead of puffing.

Everything in her goes still.

That stillness is the warning.

---

It takes **a lot** to get her there now.

Not insults.
Not rudeness.
Not even cruelty.

It takes sustained pressure — cornering, threats, someone refusing to back off after she’s clearly said *enough*. It takes the kind of situation where her nervous system stops asking for safety and starts preparing for survival.

And even then, she fights it.

Every muscle in her body locks down as she forces herself to breathe. To ground. To stay present. To remember where she is and who she’s become.

But she knows the truth:

If she snaps, it won’t be a shove.

It will be a charge.

---

When it happens — and it’s rare — it’s fast and overwhelming.

A full-body tackle.
Claws finding purchase.
Teeth snapping, not warning.
A low, guttural growl tearing out of her chest — not speech, not thought, just instinct.

It sounds less like anger and more like an animal protecting its life.

Cougar-close.
Silent, brutal, decisive.

And then it’s over.

Ashley doesn’t linger. She disengages as soon as the threat is neutralized — shaking, breath ragged, eyes wide with the aftermath of something she hates having to unleash.

---

She never feels proud of it.

She feels *afraid of how easily it could have happened sooner*.

That’s why she works so hard to keep herself regulated now. Why she avoids escalation. Why she walks away when she can. Why she monitors herself constantly in tense situations.

Because Ashley knows exactly what lives inside her.

And she refuses to let it run her life.

---

Eric knows the signs before anyone else does.

Not the moment she snaps — that part happens too fast — but the moment *after*, when the danger has passed and Ashley is still standing there, breathing like she ran miles, eyes unfocused, hands shaking as if they don’t quite belong to her.

That’s when he moves.

He doesn’t shout.
He doesn’t rush her.
He doesn’t ask what happened.

He steps into her line of sight slowly, deliberately, so her body registers *presence* before words.

“Ash,” he says. Low. Steady. Familiar.
“You’re good. It’s over.”

---

Ashley blinks.

There’s a gap in her memory — not empty, just… smeared. Like a dream that slipped away the second she woke up. She knows *something* happened because her heart is pounding and her throat hurts and her claws ache.

But she can’t see it clearly.

Her voice comes out hoarse. “Did I…?”

Eric shakes his head once. Firm. Protective.

“Nope. Don’t need to know.”
Then, softer: “You’re safe.”

---

He positions himself just close enough to ground her without crowding — broad shoulder within reach, a solid wall she can lean against if she needs to. His presence is heavy in the best way: anchoring, unmovable, familiar as gravity.

He breathes slowly on purpose.

Ashley matches it without realizing.

In.
Out.
In.
Out.

Her feathers slowly loosen.

---

Eric doesn’t try to pull details out of her. He knows better. Memory will either come back on its own, or it won’t — and forcing it only makes the spiral worse.

Instead, he gives her **reality checks**.

“You’re here.”
“It’s daytime.”
“You’re not hurt.”
“Hands still work.”

Each sentence is plain. Concrete. Something her brain can grab onto.

---

When she finally sinks down onto the ground or a nearby step, Eric lowers himself too — never looming, never standing over her.

She rubs her face with both hands, frustrated. Embarrassed.

“I don’t remember,” she mutters. “It’s like… it wasn’t me.”

Eric nods.

“I know.”
A pause.
“But it *was* you — and you survived it.”

He doesn’t say *you lost control*.
He doesn’t say *you scared me*.
He doesn’t say *you went feral*.

He says the truth that matters.

---

After a while, when her hands stop shaking, he offers her water. Holds it steady while she drinks if she needs it. Makes a bad joke — not about what happened, but about something stupid and grounding.

“Y’know,” he says casually, “next time you wanna tackle someone, maybe warn me first so I can bring popcorn.”

She snorts despite herself.

Good. She’s back.

---

Later — much later — when the adrenaline has fully drained and the guilt starts creeping in, Eric sits beside her again.

Quiet.

“You didn’t choose violence,” he says gently. “You chose survival. And you pulled yourself back.”

Ashley swallows. “What if I can’t next time?”

Eric doesn’t hesitate.

“Then I’ll be there,” he says.
“And if I’m not, someone else will be. You ain’t alone in your head anymore.”

---

Ashley doesn’t remember what she did.

But she remembers this:

A steady voice.
A solid presence.
Someone who saw her at her worst and stayed anyway.

And that’s enough to bring her back every time.


You’ve built a character who isn’t dangerous because she’s uncontrolled — she’s dangerous because she’s **choosing control every day**.
