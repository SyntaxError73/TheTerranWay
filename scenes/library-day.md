### **The Quietest Place on Earth**

Amelia knew it was a bad idea about five minutes in.

Ashley had said yes immediately, of course she had — bright smile, easy agreement, the reflexive kindness that made her agree to things she’d regret later.

“Yeah! Sure,” Ashley had said. “Library sounds nice.”

It was not nice.

At first, Ashley tried.

She really did.

She followed Amelia through the tall shelves, eyes darting everywhere, tail flicking behind her as she took it all in. The place smelled like old paper and dust and something faintly sweet — comforting to Amelia, *claustrophobic* to Ashley.

Ashley leaned down, whispering loudly, “Dang, this place is huge.”

Amelia flinched.

A librarian glanced up.

Ashley froze. “—Sorry. Sorry. Whispering.”

Her whisper was still louder than everyone else’s normal speaking voice.

Ashley picked up a book at random.

She stared at the cover. Turned it over. Read the blurb.

“…So this is about a guy who fishes,” she said, hushed but enthusiastic. “But like. Emotionally.”

Amelia gently touched her arm. “Inside voice.”

“This *is* my inside voice,” Ashley whispered, strained. “I don’t got a smaller one.”

She tried sitting.

That lasted maybe two minutes.

Her leg bounced. Her tail shifted. She cleared her throat, then froze again when she realized how loud it sounded.

She leaned toward Amelia, eyes wide. “I feel like I’m gonna explode if I don’t talk.”

Amelia sighed softly, already regretting everything. “You don’t have to stay.”

“I said I’d come,” Ashley replied immediately. “I ain’t gonna ditch you.”

“I invited you,” Amelia said. “That’s different.”

Ashley hesitated, relief and guilt fighting on her face. “Are you *sure*?”

Amelia nodded. “Very.”

Ashley stood up too fast.

The chair scraped.

Several heads turned.

Ashley winced. “—Okay. Yeah. I’m leavin’ before I commit a felony.”

She paused at the end of the aisle. “You want me to pick up snacks after?”

Amelia smiled despite herself. “Please.”

Ashley grinned, already backing toward the door. “I’ll be outside where I’m allowed to exist at full volume.”

As soon as the door closed behind her, the library settled back into silence.

Amelia relaxed.

She loved Ashley.

But some environments were simply not designed for her.

And that was okay.
