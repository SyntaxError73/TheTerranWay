### **Fall-Asleep Butter**

Ashley has rules about sleep.

She doesn’t call them superstitions. That word makes them sound silly.
She calls them *preventative measures*.

You don’t sleep with the ceiling fan on — not ever — because one time when she was little, it wobbled so badly she was convinced it was going to shear straight off and decapitate her. Logic never fully erased that image.

You don’t look at the clock while drifting off. Especially not when the minute changes. That guarantees nightmares. Not *sometimes*. Always.

These rules came from coincidence, sure — but coincidence backed by fear has a way of solidifying into law.

Sleep, to Ashley, is a necessary inconvenience.

It takes too long.
It interrupts momentum.
It steals hours she could be *doing something*.

And yet… her body demands it anyway.

---

The night the butter happened, she was tired in the worst way.

Her body was exhausted, but her brain refused to disengage. Not racing — just *idling*. Awake enough to notice everything, not awake enough to do anything useful with it.

She lay there, staring into the dark, feathers restless, thoughts dissolving into nonsense and reforming just long enough to be annoying.

That’s when it arrived.

Not a thought.

A *statement*.

> *Maybe I’ll have some fall asleep butter.*

Her own voice.

Clear. Calm. Certain.

Ashley opened her eyes.

“Well,” she murmured, sitting up, “that feels important.”

---

She didn’t question it.

That part of her brain — the one that speaks during hypnagogia — had authority. It didn’t ask questions. It issued solutions.

So she padded to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and sliced a small piece of salted butter like this was a completely normal thing to do at midnight.

She ate it.

No ceremony. No expectations.

Back to bed.

---

She fell asleep almost immediately.

No dreams. No jerks awake. No clock-checking. Just *out*.

When she woke the next morning, the conclusion formed instantly and without debate:

*The butter worked.*

---

And just like that, a new rule was born.

Fall-asleep butter.

Not for every night — only for the bad ones. The rare nights where sleep refuses to arrive and her brain starts whispering nonsense that somehow feels true.

She doesn’t even crave it. It’s not about hunger.

It’s about ritual.

About reassurance.

About telling her nervous system, *See? We know what to do.*

---

Ashley knows, intellectually, that butter is not a sedative.

She also knows that ceiling fans don’t usually fall, clocks don’t cause nightmares, and that sleep is not an enemy.

But knowing something and *feeling safe* are different things.

And on the nights when sleep feels fragile and her thoughts won’t settle?

She opens the fridge.

Cuts a slice.

And trusts the rule.

Because sometimes the brain just needs to believe it has a key.
