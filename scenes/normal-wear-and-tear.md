### **Normal Wear and Tear**

It happened on a Sunday afternoon.

Those were the days when everything slowed down enough for small truths to show themselves.

Ashley stood at the stove, humming softly, tail flicking behind her as she cracked eggs into a pan. Not *those* eggs — those were wrapped carefully in foil in the fridge for later, like always. Routine. Managed.

She winced briefly as a familiar ache passed through her lower abdomen, then exhaled and carried on like nothing happened.

“Still good?” Eric asked from the table.

“Yeah,” she said easily. “Just my body bein’ a nuisance.”

Eric nodded. He understood nuisance.

He eyed the glass of orange juice Lewis had poured himself and grimaced. “You know that stuff’s poison.”

Lewis shrugged, shoulder twitching sharply as he did. Then twitching again.

Ashley watched him. “You’re doin’ the thing.”

Lewis paused. “…Am I?”

“Yep.”

He rolled his shoulders deliberately, trying to reset them. “Huh. Didn’t feel it this time.”

Eric pushed the juice away with a toe. “If that touches my stomach, I’m outta commission for hours. Ain’t worth it.”

“Fruit juice from concentrate is worse,” Lewis said helpfully.

Eric pointed at him. “See? He knows.”

Across the room, Jeannie adjusted her glasses and stared at her reflection in the darkened TV screen. The lines were subtle, but they were there — softening where things used to be sharp.

She touched her cheek absently.

John snored.

Not loudly — not yet — but enough that Primal looked over from the couch, concerned.

“How is he doing?” Primal asked quietly.

Jeannie sighed. “He forgets the mask sometimes.”

John snorted awake at the sound of his name. “I’m fine.”

“You had whiskey,” Jeannie said gently.

“…Yeah.”

She handed him a glass of water. He took it without argument.

Amelia emerged from the hallway, glasses perched a little crooked, nose already pink from pollen season.

“I can’t see *anything* without these,” she muttered, squinting. “And I sneezed six times in a row.”

Ashley laughed. “Bless you in advance.”

Amelia paused, shifting slightly. “I also need to—” she stopped, swallowed. “Never mind.”

Primal noticed immediately.

“There’s a bathroom free,” he said calmly.

She smiled gratefully and hurried off, tail swishing with urgency.

The house settled again.

Not quiet — just comfortable.

Bodies weren’t perfect here. They ached. They misfired. They had limits and quirks and betrayals that arrived without warning.

But nobody apologized for it.

Ashley flipped eggs. Eric stretched his back carefully. Lewis absentmindedly rolled his shoulders again. Jeannie rested a hand on John’s arm. Amelia returned calmer, clearer. Primal handed out snacks like it was his calling.

This was what life looked like when nobody pretended to be invincible.

Just people — unusual, imperfect, and deeply familiar — sharing space and learning how to take care of one another in all the small, unglamorous ways that mattered most.

And somehow, that felt like the truest kind of health.
