### **The Fridge**

Ashley stood in front of the open fridge, door light washing over her like a stage spotlight. She tapped her claws against the tile and sang softly, half-thinking, half-complaining.

“Sweet tea’s fine, I guess it’s okay,
Water’s dull, it’s got no say.
Sports drinks try a little too hard,
Soda’s tempting — just one card.”

Lewis, sprawled on the couch, perked up immediately.

“Oh,” he said. “We’re doing this.”

Ashley ignored him.

“Milkshakes feel too thick, too slow,
Smoothies lie more than they show.
Coffee’s Amelia’s thing, not mine,
So what do I drink this time?”

She sighed dramatically.

From the couch:
🎵 “WHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL?” 🎵

Ashley groaned. “Lewis.”

“I’m just sayin’,” he continued, sitting up. “Statistically, it’s an option.”

She added another line, resigned but honest:

“Booze would win in one good sip,
Fruity drinks or a light beer’d hit—
But it dries you out and that’s the catch,
So no, I can’t just pick that batch.”

Lewis clapped once. “Excellent verse. Very responsible.”

Ashley shot him a look. “Do not encourage me.”

“I’m not,” he said. “I’m narrating. There’s a difference.”

She stared back into the fridge, defeated.

“So what do I drink?” she muttered.

Lewis leaned back again. “Nothing. You’ll stand there for ten minutes, close the fridge, walk away, come back, and repeat the cycle.”

Ashley paused.

“…Rude,” she said.

“But accurate,” he replied.

She grabbed a random bottle without looking. “I hate you.”

Lewis smiled. “You’re welcome.”

And five minutes later, she was back at the fridge.

Singing the first line again.
