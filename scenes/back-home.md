### **Home**

The taxi pulled away with a soft hiss of tires on pavement.

Ashley lingered in the doorway for a moment, watching the taillights vanish down the street. “She didn’t even argue,” she said quietly.

Primal stepped up beside her, tail curling once. “That’s… not usual.”

“Nope.”

They turned just in time to see Amelia drift past the entryway and make it exactly three feet into the living room before gravity won.

She didn’t coil.
Didn’t arrange herself.
Didn’t even reach for a blanket.

She just… folded.

Her tail lay slack across the rug, unguarded, uncurled. Her head tipped sideways against the couch cushion, mouth parted slightly as sleep claimed her with startling speed.

Out cold.

Ashley winced. “Oh. Yeah. She’s *done* done.”

Primal froze, instinct flaring — not alarm, but recognition. This wasn’t danger. This was collapse. The kind that only happens when someone feels safe enough to let go completely.

“She didn’t even take her shoes off,” he murmured.

“She doesn’t wear shoes,” Ashley said automatically, then sighed. “You know what I mean.”

They stood there for a second longer, neither moving, as if afraid that acknowledging the moment too loudly might wake her.

Primal was the first to act.

He moved quietly, deliberately, retrieving a blanket and kneeling beside her. He paused, hesitated — then gently tucked the edge around her shoulders, careful not to startle her awake. Her breathing stayed slow, even.

Ashley crouched nearby, resting her elbows on her knees. “She always coils when she sleeps,” she said softly.

Primal nodded. “This feels… different.”

“It is,” Ashley replied. “Means she didn’t have anything left to manage.”

They watched her for a moment — the faint rise and fall of her chest, the way her tail lay completely unprotected.

Safe.

Primal adjusted the blanket again, then quietly placed a glass of water on the coffee table within easy reach. “I’ll make soup,” he said. “For when she wakes up.”

Ashley smiled, fond and a little sad. “She’s gonna wake up confused and embarrassed.”

“She doesn’t need to be,” he replied. “Everyone collapses sometimes.”

Ashley bumped her shoulder lightly against his. “You’re good for her.”

He flushed faintly. “So are you.”

They left the lights low. No music. No talking. Just the quiet hum of home holding someone who’d finally let herself stop.

And Amelia slept — deeply, uncoiled, unguarded — wrapped not just in a blanket, but in the unspoken promise that she didn’t have to stay upright all the time.
