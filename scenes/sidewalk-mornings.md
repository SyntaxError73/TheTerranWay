### **Sidewalk Mornings**

Ashley liked the morning best before it remembered to be busy.

She jogged along the sidewalk just after sunrise, boots hitting concrete in a steady rhythm, breath fogging faintly in the cool air. The world felt softer at this hour—like it hadn’t fully decided what kind of day it was going to be yet.

Lawns were still damp with dew. Sprinklers ticked and hissed in uneven arcs. Somewhere behind a fence, a dog barked once, half-hearted, then went quiet again.

Ashley waved anyway.

She passed an older man carefully sweeping his driveway, every motion deliberate. He looked up as she went by.

“Mornin’,” he called.

“Mornin’!” she replied easily, accent warm and familiar.

A few blocks later, a woman sat on her porch with a mug of coffee, wrapped in a robe too thin for the temperature. She watched the sky more than the street, eyes tired but peaceful.

Ashley slowed just enough to nod at her. The woman smiled back, like they shared a secret.

At the corner, the bakery truck arrived—right on time. The smell hit Ashley like a memory: bread, sugar, heat. She grinned and made a mental note to come back later if Amelia needed bribing into a good mood.

Pigeons scattered as she passed, wings flapping indignantly. A squirrel froze halfway up a tree, judging her with its whole tiny soul.

“Yeah, yeah,” Ashley muttered fondly. “I see you.”

She crossed paths with a jogger moving the opposite direction—headphones in, eyes forward, expression set. They didn’t notice her at all. That was fine. Not every moment had to be shared.

Further down, the sidewalk cracked and buckled where roots pushed up from beneath. Ashley adjusted without thinking, body moving around obstacles like it always had. She liked how Earth’s cities tried to be neat, and how nature quietly disagreed.

Near the park, she slowed to a walk.

A stray cat lounged on a low wall, grooming itself with meticulous focus. It glanced up as Ashley passed, unimpressed. A crow hopped along the grass nearby, watching her with one sharp eye, then the other.

Ashley tipped her head at it. “Mornin’ to you too.”

The crow cawed once, like it approved.

By the time she looped back toward home, the street was waking up properly. Cars began to move. Doors opened. Voices drifted from open windows. The quiet didn’t vanish—it just folded itself into something louder.

Ashley jogged the last stretch with a lightness in her chest.

She liked these mornings. The ordinary ones. The ones where nothing happened except the world continuing to exist, steady and imperfect.

And when she reached the house, breath warm, feathers just starting to fluff with exertion, she knew she’d seen exactly what she needed to see.

Another day.

And plenty of it still ahead.
