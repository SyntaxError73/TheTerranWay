### **The Thing Said Out Loud**

They were walking when it happened.

Not anywhere special — just a stretch of road where the trees leaned close and the ground felt familiar underfoot. Ashley liked walking with her mom because it didn’t require eye contact. You could talk side by side and let the world absorb the pauses.

They were already deep into it — talking about Terra, about Earth, about how strange it was to feel older and younger at the same time.

Jeannie sighed. “You know… you weren’t always this patient.”

Ashley smiled faintly. “No. I was kinda awful.”

Jeannie nodded, thoughtful. Then, too casually:

“Like when you pushed that girl in elementary school.”

Ashley stopped walking.

Just stopped.

The world didn’t freeze — birds still moved, wind still brushed the leaves — but something inside her went very still.

Jeannie kept going for half a step before realizing Ashley wasn’t beside her anymore.

She turned.

Ashley hadn’t gone rigid or angry. She just looked… smaller. Her shoulders had pulled inward, jaw tight, eyes fixed on a point that wasn’t there.

“That was unnecessary,” Ashley said quietly.

Jeannie blinked. “I didn’t mean—”

“I know,” Ashley interrupted, still not looking at her. “But I don’t need to hear that.”

The words weren’t sharp. They were controlled. That somehow made them hurt more.

Jeannie swallowed. “I was just—”

“I know,” Ashley said again, firmer this time. “But I live with that already.”

They stood there in silence.

Jeannie saw it then — not the child Ashley had been, but the adult who had spent years *not being that person anymore*. Who carried the memory like a bruise you don’t press on.

“I shouldn’t have brought it up like that,” Jeannie said softly.

Ashley nodded once. “Yeah.”

They finished the walk, but the air between them stayed tender.

That night, Jeannie knocked on Ashley’s door.

“Can I come in?”

Ashley hesitated, then nodded.

Jeannie sat on the edge of the chair instead of the bed, hands folded. “I’m sorry,” she said plainly. “That wasn’t fair to you.”

Ashley exhaled slowly. “It just… surprised me.”

“I wasn’t trying to hurt you,” Jeannie said. “But intent don’t matter much when the wound’s still there.”

Ashley finally looked at her. “I don’t like who I was.”

“I know,” Jeannie said gently. “That’s why I shouldn’t have dragged her into the room.”

Ashley’s shoulders eased a fraction.

Jeannie added, “For what it’s worth… I see who you chose to become. I’m proud of *that* girl.”

Ashley’s voice wavered despite herself. “You already had that girl. She just needed time.”

Jeannie smiled sadly. “We all do.”

They didn’t hug right away.

But when they did, it was slow and sure — the kind of apology that doesn’t erase the sting, but softens it enough to heal.

And Jeannie never brought it up like that again.
