### **The Floor Is Still Lava**

Ashley doesn’t notice she’s doing it at first.

She’s walking through the woods, barefoot as always, leaves damp underfoot, ground soft and forgiving. Her brain is half somewhere else — cataloging sounds, smells, the way the light breaks through the canopy.

Then she pauses.

Steps back.

Eyes flick from stone to root to fallen log.

“…Okay,” she murmurs.

She steps onto the rock instead of the dirt.

Then onto the log. Then a tree root that’s just barely raised enough to count. Her arms lift slightly for balance, secondary arms hovering instinctively, tail countering each shift of weight.

She smiles.

The floor is lava.

It was a game when she was little — hopping couch to chair to table, shrieking when her foot slipped, scrambling onto John’s lap like the lava was real and *mean*. The rules were loose. The joy wasn’t.

Out here, the rules are different but familiar.

Mud is lava.
Cold water is lava.
Sharp gravel is lava.

Solid things are safe.

She moves carefully, thoughtfully, letting the game guide her without rushing her. It turns walking into intention. Keeps her from zoning out too hard. Keeps her present in her body.

Sometimes she misjudges.

Her foot slips. She lands in the dirt with a soft *thump*, leaves sticking to her calves.

Ashley laughs quietly, brushing herself off. “Welp.”

She stands back up, scans for the next stepping stone.

No one is watching. No one needs an explanation.

It’s not childish.

It’s grounding.

It’s a way to turn the world into something navigable again — to give shape to space, rules to movement, joy to being where her feet actually are.

She hops to the next rock, balance steady, eyes bright.

The floor is lava.

Lewis squints at the ground, hands on his hips like he’s about to ruin everyone’s day.

“Okay,” he says slowly, “but what if the floor was *actually* lava.”

Ashley doesn’t even look at him. She steps neatly onto a rock, then a root, then another rock, like she’s been waiting for this question her whole life.

“But only when you’re *thinkin’ about it*,” she says.

Lewis’s eyes widen. “Oh no.”

Ashley grins, hopping again. “See, if you’re not aware of it, it’s inert lava. Dormant.”

Lewis points at the dirt. “So right now—”

“—right now,” Ashley says brightly, “you’re dead.”

Lewis yelps and scrambles onto the nearest log. “WHY WOULD YOU DESIGN IT LIKE THAT.”

Ashley shrugs, completely serious. “Observation-based hazard. Very elegant.”

Lewis clutches his chest. “That’s not a game, that’s a *philosophy problem*.”

Ashley tilts her head. “Yeah. The floor is lava, but consent-based.”

Lewis stares at her.

“…That tracks.”


And somehow, she’s still winning.
