### **Nature's End Credits**

That excitement lived right up until the wind spoke.

The sky had already gone the right color—green-gray, heavy, like it was thinking about something important. Thunder rolled slow and deep over the hills, flashes of lightning tearing bright seams through the clouds.

Ashley practically vibrated.

“Oh *heck* yeah,” she said, pressing her hands to the window. “Hear that? That’s end-credits thunder.”

John laughed from his chair, already leaning forward like the storm was a show he’d paid for. “That’s the good stuff right there. Real cinematic.”

Another flash split the sky—brighter this time, immediate thunder right on its heels.

Ashley whooped. “That one had *production value*.”

They stood there together, shoulder to shoulder, grinning like kids, counting the seconds between flash and boom, arguing over whether that one sounded more like a drumroll or a title drop.

Lewis hovered nearby, phone out, radar pulled up. “Technically,” he said, “this cell has some impressive vertical development.”

Ashley glanced back at him. “You say that like it ain’t romance.”

“I’m sayin’ it *is* romance,” he replied, “just… in data form.”

Another thunderclap rattled the windows.

Ashley beamed.

Then the wind hit.

Not loud. Not violent.

Just enough.

The trees outside answered immediately—branches creaking, leaves hissing, one long limb scraping across the side of the house with a sound that made Ashley’s chest tighten.

Her smile faltered.

*What if a tree falls on our house?*

The thought slid in clean and logical, like it belonged there. They lived in the woods. Trees fell sometimes. It wasn’t catastrophizing—it was *math*.

Her tail went still.

John noticed. He always did.

“Hey,” he said gently, not turning away from the window. “That wind ain’t doin’ much.”

Ashley nodded, but her eyes tracked the tall oak closest to the house. Watched it sway. Watched the canopy move as one.

*It could be that one.*
*Or that one.*

Her excitement dimmed, not gone but pressed down under vigilance.

Lewis glanced up from his phone. “Gusts aren’t that strong,” he said calmly. “This isn’t a microburst situation.”

She appreciated that. He wasn’t dismissing the fear—just contextualizing it.

Ashley exhaled slowly.

“I love storms,” she said quietly. “Just… not when they start pushin’ stuff.”

John nodded. “Fair.”

Another flash. Another boom. No new wind.

Her shoulders loosened again.

“Now,” she added, warming back up, “this is my favorite kind. Thunder. Light show. No trees auditionin’ for violence.”

Lewis snorted.

They watched the storm roll past, Ashley and John narrating it like it was the dramatic finale of a movie neither of them wanted to end.

“Hear that?” Ashley said, eyes bright again. “That’s the part where the camera pans up to the sky.”

John grinned. “Cue the music.”

Lewis shook his head fondly. “Y’all are ridiculous.”

Ashley didn’t argue.

She loved tornadoes—tight, elegant, terrible and beautiful all at once. A single thread of destruction you could see, respect, track. Hurricanes, though?

“Nope,” she’d say every time. “Too big. Too much. That’s just the world takin’ a swing.”

Tornadoes were poetry.
Hurricanes were essays.

The thunder faded eventually. The wind settled. The trees held.

Ashley leaned back against the wall, excitement ebbing into contentment.

The world wasn’t ending.

But for a little while?

It sounded like it might—and that was enough to make her smile, as long as the trees stayed where they were.
