Lewis had wanted a snake for a long time.
Not in a passing, that’d be cool way—but in the quiet, persistent way that meant the idea never really left him alone. He researched habitats. Temperatures. Humidity. Feeding schedules. Read forums late at night. Watched videos with the sound low so no one would ask questions yet.
When he finally asked Jeannie, he did it carefully.
“I want a pet snake.”
Jeannie didn’t flinch. She didn’t recoil. She didn’t even say no right away.
She just sighed and sat down.
“It ain’t the snake, honey,” she said after a moment. “I like snakes. They’re pretty. Calm. Honest.”
Lewis perked up. “Then—?”
“I don’t like the feedin’,” she said softly. “Feels wrong to me. That mouse or rat had a whole little life, and now it’s just… food.”
Lewis went quiet.
He hadn’t thought about it that way—not emotionally. Practically, sure. But not that.
“I wouldn’t make you watch,” he said immediately. “Ever. I promise. You wouldn’t even have to be in the same room.”
Jeannie looked at him. “I know you’d take care of it.”
“I would,” he said. “I swear. I’ll handle everything. Thawin’. Cleanin’. All of it.”
She hesitated. “You’d thaw it… where?”
Lewis blinked. “…My room?”
Jeannie closed her eyes briefly. “Your room where bowls from the kitchen disappear?”
Lewis winced. “I’ll label them.”
She gave him the look.
“…New bowls,” he amended. “Snake-only bowls.”
That got a reluctant smile out of her.
“And I won’t talk about it when I feed her,” he added earnestly. “I know that makes you sad. I’ll just… do it. Quiet.”
Jeannie studied him for a long moment—really looked at him. At the way he wasn’t excited in a reckless way, but steady. Thoughtful. Protective.
“…Alright,” she said finally. “On those terms.”
Lewis’s face lit up like someone had turned the sun on.
The reptile convention was overwhelming in the best way.
Heat lamps. Low murmurs. The soft rustle of scales. Lewis moved slowly, reverently, hands tucked in his pockets so he wouldn’t touch without permission.
Then he saw her.
A small hognose snake, curled neatly in her enclosure, earthy browns and warm caramel tones patterned gently along her body. When Lewis leaned closer, she flattened her head dramatically—classic hognose theatrics—then immediately gave up and pretended to be very intimidating and very flat at the same time.
Lewis laughed under his breath.
“Oh,” he said. “You’re dramatic.”
The handler smiled. “She’s a girl. Very gentle. Big personality.”
The snake flicked her tongue at him.
Something about her—shy, expressive, a little theatrical in her own quiet way—hit him square in the chest.
She reminded him of Amelia.
Not the snake part—the energy. The way she protested softly, then settled. The way she observed before engaging.
“…I want her,” Lewis said, without hesitation.
He named her Caramel on the drive home.
A joke only he would make.
Caramel.
Carr–amel.
A soft, sweet play on Amelia Carr—who had been in his grade even though she was a year older, who drew next to him in class, who understood creativity and quiet better than most people ever did.
Ashley was Amelia’s best friend.
Lewis was… adjacent. Parallel. Same orbit, different gravity.
That was fine.
Caramel settled into her enclosure like she’d always lived there.
Lewis set everything up meticulously—temperature, hides, substrate. He talked to her while he worked, voice low and gentle, explaining things she didn’t need explained.
“You don’t gotta do anything,” he told her. “I’ll handle it.”
When feeding day came, he closed his door.
Thawed the mouse carefully, in the snake-only bowl, on a counter he had actually cleaned. He didn’t rush. Didn’t flinch.
Caramel ate calmly.
Jeannie stayed in the living room, deliberately not thinking about it.
Later, Lewis emerged, washed his hands, and said nothing.
Jeannie nodded in quiet thanks.
Over time, Caramel became part of the household rhythm.
She rode in the crook of Lewis’s arm sometimes, tongue flicking, completely unbothered by his cluttered room or wandering thoughts. She didn’t care if he forgot where he put things—as long as her heat lamp stayed on and her water stayed fresh.
Lewis never forgot her.
And sometimes, when Amelia visited, she’d sit coiled on the floor and watch Caramel move, sketching her gentle curves in a notebook.
“She’s pretty,” Amelia said once.
Lewis smiled. “I know.”
Ashley would roll her eyes fondly. “Of course you got a snake.”
Lewis shrugged. “Of course I did.”
Because Lewis had always been that kid—the one with animals in his pockets, empathy tuned a little too wide, heart inclined toward quiet, misunderstood creatures.
Caramel just made it official.
She curled contentedly in her hide, warm and safe, and Lewis felt—maybe for the first time in a while—that something in his life fit exactly the way it was supposed to.
