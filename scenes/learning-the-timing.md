### **Learning the Timing**

Sauromorph bodies didn’t work like human ones.

That was something Ashley learned early — not as a problem, just as a fact. Smaller-bodied subspecies like the Hunters ran hot and efficient. Food burned clean. Waste didn’t linger.

For most of the family, that meant a rhythm of a few days between needs. Predictable. Manageable.

For Ashley, though, it never *crept up*.

It *arrived*.

No warning buzz. No slow build. Just a sudden, unmistakable signal that demanded immediate action — the kind you didn’t argue with, didn’t negotiate with, didn’t ignore.

It had been that way since she was toilet trained.

She learned fast: when it hit, you moved.

The middle school play was when she learned *how important* that rule really was.

She wasn’t a lead. She wasn’t even close. She was playing a chicken — one of several — a background role meant to fill the stage and make the scene feel alive.

It mattered to her anyway.

Her parents were in the audience. Eric might be there. Being onstage meant something.

She was waiting in the wings, counting minutes until her cue.

Three minutes.

Then it hit.

Her stomach dropped — not in pain, not in panic, just certainty. She knew her body well enough by then.

Three minutes wasn’t possible.

She ran the route in her head. Nearest restroom. Clear hallway. She could make it — *just* — but she also knew what that meant.

She wouldn’t make it back in time.

Ashley didn’t hesitate.

She went.

She barely made it, heart racing, breath tight — and afterward she stood there for a moment, hands braced against the wall, steadying herself.

Relief came first.

Then the realization.

The play was already moving on without her.

Afterward, she told the truth.

To her parents. To the director. Calmly. Clearly. No drama.

“I didn’t know before,” she explained. “It don’t work like that for me.”

The director frowned. “Why didn’t you go earlier?”

Ashley answered honestly. “I didn’t need to.”

Her parents listened. Really listened.

They weren’t angry. They weren’t disappointed. They were concerned — not about the play, but about *her*.

Eric put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed. “You did the right thing.”

John, later that night, tried to lighten the mood by giving her a nickname that made Ashley groan and laugh at the same time.

She rolled her eyes. “Dad.”

They took her to a doctor.

Everything checked out.

Healthy. Normal. Just built that way.

And that was the most important part.

---

From then on, Ashley learned to prepare.

She stopped assuming she had time.

She planned exits. Took cues seriously. Trusted her body instead of fighting it.

It wasn’t stubbornness — it was survival.

She never waited it out again.

Because for Ashley, listening early meant never having to clean up a mess later.

And that wasn’t shame.

That was wisdom.
