Ashley didn’t go out looking for a cat.

She was just taking the long way home — not a shortcut, *never* a shortcut this time — when she felt something brush against her boot.

She stopped.

Looked down.

A very small, very determined kitten stared back up at her.

It was scruffy, gray, and entirely unafraid. Its tail stuck straight up like an exclamation point, and before Ashley could even speak, it rubbed its face against her ankle and started purring like it had already made a decision.

“Well I’ll be,” Ashley murmured, crouching. “Ain’t you bold.”

The kitten answered by climbing her pant leg.

Ashley laughed. “Alright, alright, I get it.”

By the time she made it home, the kitten was tucked securely against her chest, peeking out of her jacket like it belonged there.

Primal noticed immediately.

He paused in the kitchen doorway, eyes widening just a little. “…Is that a cat?”

Ashley beamed. “I got chosen.”

The kitten meowed on cue.

Primal crouched instantly, calm cracking just enough to let delight through. “Yeah,” he said reverently. “That sure is something.”

Amelia appeared a moment later, curiosity winning out over caution.

“What’s all the—” she stopped short.

The kitten looked at her.

Amelia looked at the kitten.

Something deep in her chest *melted*.

“…Oh no,” she whispered.

The kitten wobbled forward, tiny paws tapping against the floor, and let out a small, questioning chirp.

Amelia clasped her hands under her chin. “You are *illegal*. You cannot just exist like that.”

She took one step closer.

Then her eyes itched.

She blinked. Once. Twice.

“…I am still allergic,” she said, voice strained with betrayal.

Ashley froze. “Oh. Oh no. I forgot.”

Primal straightened slowly, concern immediate but gentle. “How bad?”

Amelia rubbed at her eye, already watering. “Not life-threatening. Just… deeply inconvenient.”

The kitten chose that moment to flop over dramatically and expose its belly.

Amelia made a small, wounded sound.

“I can’t touch it,” she said. “I want to touch it so badly.”

Ashley hovered helplessly. “We can keep it outta your room. I’ll vacuum more. I swear.”

Primal nodded. “I will brush it. Daily. Maybe twice.”

The kitten sneezed.

Amelia sneezed *back*.

They stared at each other.

“…This is war,” Amelia said quietly.

She retreated to the couch with a tissue, eyes red but expression soft. She watched as Ashley carefully set up a temporary bed, and Primal offered the kitten a bowl of water like it was a sacred rite.

The kitten immediately curled up against Primal’s leg, purring.

Primal didn’t move.

“I am compromised,” he admitted softly.

Ashley laughed. “You’re done for.”

Amelia sniffed, blinking through tears — some from allergies, some from emotion. “I can’t believe I’m allergic to something I love this much.”

The kitten looked at her again and chirped.

Amelia smiled helplessly. “…You’re worth it.”

Primal glanced at her. “We’ll manage,” he said calmly. “Yeah.”

Ashley nodded. “We always do.”

The kitten purred louder, utterly unconcerned with the chaos it had caused.

And Amelia sat there, itchy-eyed and resigned, already planning antihistamines — because sometimes love comes with fur, and sometimes it makes you sneeze.

But it’s still love.
